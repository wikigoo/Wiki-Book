### MEDIA NEIGHBOURHOOD

### PROJECT

```
Media Neighbourhood is a 3 year €4.5 million European Union funded project which delivers a
journalism training and networking programme across 17 European Union neighbouring countries:
Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Morocco,
Palestine, the Russian Federation, Syria, Tunisia, Ukraine.
The project aims to build the capacity of the media across the Middle East, Eastern Europe and
Caucasus regions to effectively and professionally report on key social, political and economic issues.
By the end of the project over 1,200 journalists and students of journalism from the 17 countries
covered by the Media Neighbourhood project will have participated in the programme.
The programme’s two key objectives are:
```
- To strengthen the professional capacity of journalists, particularly in the areas of media
    independence and online media
- To enable journalists to better understand and improve the quality of their reporting on the
    European Union, its policies and activities in Neighbourhood area.

The Regional Communication Programme

```
The European Union funded Regional Communication Programme, which runs
from 2011 to 2014 with a total budget of 14 million euros, aims to improve
knowledge of the European Union and its neighbourhood policy.
The programme contributes to greater understanding of European Union policies
and highlights cooperation actions carried out in the region. The programme works
on developing sustainable communication networks and aims to strengthen the
capacity and competencies of journalists in the area of European affairs. It follows
on from the previous phase of the Regional Communication Programme.

### THE EUROPEAN UNION

```
The European Union has 28 member states with more than 500 million citizens. Spend some time
familiarising yourself with the structure of the European Union by browsing the web sites in the adjacent
European Union section of Journalism Resources.
Then you will be ready to go to the specific website handling press and media information for individual
institutions. The European Union is very good at providing not only news but also background information
and guides online. There is a wealth of information sources available on the official European Union websites,
of which the main ones are listed below.
There is a spokesperson for each DIRECTORATE GENERAL (DG) of the European Commission and
services in all other institutions such as the Council, the European Parliament, European External Action
Service (EEAS), etc. At the Commission, there is the daily (except holidays) midday briefing in Brussels, which
can be watched live on the audio visual service, or replayed subsequently. This is a good place to learn the
issues of the day, to hear the European Union’s response to events in the news and to get usable quotations
or clips for use in print or audio visual media. This site can also show you who to contact if you want to
know more on any specific topic, or if you want information about a topic that was not raised at the press
briefing. Take a look and click to find out what topics were raised today. Each topic has a different video clip:
http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/ebs/schedule.cfm
Press releases and other tip-offs can generally be found on the European Union’s NEWSROOM site:
http://europa.eu/newsroom/index_en.htm
This site enables you to search for press releases on a specific topic in different languages:
http://europa.eu/rapid/search.htm
RSS feeds, EU Tube, Twitter and Facebook are also widely used, while many Commissioners and other
officials maintain their own blogs.
This site does a similar job of making press releases available for the EUROPEAN COMMISSION under
different policy areas: http://ec.europa.eu/news/index_en.htm
Here is a similar site for the EUROPEAN EXTERNAL ACTION SERVICE (EEAS), the foreign service of the
European Union which lists telephone numbers and e-mails for the EEAS Spokespersons and Press Officers.
Remember it is these officials’ job to answer questions from the press and broadcasts media. They will
provide answers to your questions: http://eeas.europa.eu/ashton/spokespersons/index_en.htm
As a journalist based in the Neighbourhood area, you are advised to turn first to the European Union
Delegation office in your country - especially if your query is about relations between your country and
the EU. Using the directory on this site you can find websites, e-mails and telephone numbers for European
Union Delegation offices in the region: http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/repdel/edelhrm/index.
cfm?fuseaction=crepdel.europa&lang=EN
This site makes available press releases by the COUNCIL OF the EUROPEAN UNION (Council of
Ministers): http://www.consilium.europa.eu/showPage.aspx?id=1&lang=en
This site makes available press releases by the EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: http://www.europarl.europa.eu/

deciding what story to pursue. Alternatively, where he or she has a specific topic in mind, they will trawl
these sites to see what has been said already on the topic before, for example, contacting a spokesperson
for a statement. Once you become familiar with these sites you will learn who you should contact.

### REPORTING THE EUROPEAN

### UNION - OVERVIEW

```
Professional and objective reporting of the European Union and its activities is at the heart of this project.
It is widely acknowledged that the European Union has an impact not just on member states themselves, and
on accession states – those, primarily in the Western Balkans that are in the preparation phase of joining -
but also on the Neighbourhood states of North Africa, the Middle East and the former Soviet Union. These
states, as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, have effectively formed a ring of the European Union’s
near neighbours since its enlargement of new states in 2004.
```
EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY: BACKGROUND

- Developed in 2004 to avoid the emergence of new dividing lines between the enlarged European Union
    and its neighbours and to strengthen prosperity, stability and security.
- Bilateral policy between the European Union and 16 of its closest neighbours – Algeria, Armenia,
    Azerbaijan, Belarus, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Morocco, Palestine, Syria,
    Tunisia and Ukraine.
- Regional and multilateral co-operation initiatives: the Eastern Partnership (launched in Prague in May
    2009), the Union for the Mediterranean (the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, formerly known as the
    Barcelona Process, re-launched in Paris in July 2008) and the Black Sea Synergy (launched in Kiev in
    February 2008).
- Bilateral Action Plans between the European Union and each ENP partner (12 of them were agreed)
    - agenda of political and economic reforms with short and medium-term priorities of 3 to 5 years -
    democracy and human rights, rule of law, good governance, market economy principles and sustainable
    development.
- Existing agreements between the European Union and the partner in question: Partnership and
    Cooperation Agreements (PCA) or Association Agreements (AA).
- Implementation of the ENP is jointly promoted and monitored through the Committees. Sub-
    Committees promote and monitor progress.
- The European Union publishes each year the ENP Progress Reports. You can normally find them by
    searching the home page of the External Action Service (http://eeas.europa.eu)

EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICY: FUNDING

- The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) (2007-2013)- targets sustainable
    development and approximation to EU policies and standards - supporting the agreed priorities in the
    ENP Action Plans, as well as the Strategic Partnership with Russia. It has been replaced by the European
    Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI). Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020 - €15,433 billion
- 2014 Budget Allocation: € 2,132 480 712


NEIGHBOURHOOD

This project is being delivered by a consortium

led by BBC Media Action.• Eastern Partnership Countries: € 599 885 412

- EU assistance priorities are identified, together with the countries concerned in general Country
    Strategy Papers (CSPs) covering 7 year periods, National and Regional Indicative Programmes (NIPs)
    covering 3 years and detailed annual programmes.
The Neighbourhood policy, in the European Union’s own words, “is a broad political strategy which has
the objective of strengthening the prosperity, stability and security of Europe’s neighbourhood in order to
avoid any dividing lines between the enlarged EU and its direct neighbours.” The EU has bilateral agreements
with each of the 16 neighbourhood partner countries, which involve a programme of assistance, including
financial, aimed at “creating an area of shared values, stability and prosperity, enhanced co-operation and
deeper economic and regional integration by covering a wide range of co-operation areas”. Priorities in each
country differ, but the EU’s core principles, including rule-of-law, market economy, developing of democratic
institutions, border security and equality feature prominently in the assistance programme to each country.
The media’s role in reporting the EU’s work in partnership countries cannot be understated. The situation
in each country is very different and often complex. In Ukraine, for example, the decision of the Yanukovych
government not to sign the Association Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine kicked off
the chain of events that eventually jeopardised the overall stability of the country. In some of the “Arab
Spring” countries, the challenge is building democratic institutions and securing the rule-of-law. Crucially,
the European Union is supporting countries neighbouring Syria to assimilate tens of thousands of refugees.
In these countries, reporting of the European Union is intrinsically linked with stories of global significance
that dominate the news bulletins day after day. And the other countries from the Neighbourhood area are
also impacted, if not directly, by the situation in Ukraine (Eastern countries, especially Moldova and Georgia)
and the situation in Syria –(Southern countries).
One of the main lessons that are hammered home during the Reporting the EU courses is the need for
journalists to understand the European Union’s institutions.

THE EU INSTITUTIONAL TRIANGLE OF DECISION-MAKING

```
The European Commission initiates legislation, Guardian of the Treaties - represents the interests of the
European Union as a whole.
The European Parliament and the Council of ministers: decide on the legislation adoption.
The European Parliament represents the interests of European Citizens.
The Council of the EU (often referred to as just the Council or the Council of Ministers) represents the
member state governments.
```

```
Without a thorough grasp of the make-up, function and competence of the various institutions, journalists
will not be able to fully explain to their audience the full implications of a particular EU action or statement.
It is therefore crucial that any journalist reporting on the EU is familiar with the institutions, as outlined by
the European Union itself:
The European Council sets the EU’s overall political direction – but has no powers to pass laws. Led by its
President and comprising national heads of state or government and the President of the Commission, it
meets for a few days at a time at least every six months.

```
There are 3 main institutions involved in European Union legislation:
```
- The European Parliament, which represents the EU’s citizens and is directly elected by them
- The Council of the European Union, which represents the governments of the individual member countries.
    The Presidency of the Council is shared by the member states on a rotating basis
- The European Commission, which represents the interests of the Union as a whole and is the only institution
    at EU level that can initiate legislation.
Journalists sometimes make the mistake of assuming that the Council of Europe, based in Strasbourg, which was
set up to promote democracy and protect human rights and the rule-of-law, is part of the European Union. It is
not, and such mistakes diminish the credibility of news organisations that make them.
In addition to understanding the institutions, it is also crucial to apply journalistic ethical norms when reporting
on the European Union. It is in no-one’s interest, least of all the European Union itself, for journalists to slavishly
regurgitate press releases from the institutions without questioning what they mean, who they will affect and
assessing who, if anyone, could be opposed to a proposed action. Failure to do these things could lead to
accusations that a news outlet is not sufficiently impartial and this could impact on its reputation and that of the
institutions on which it is reporting. The Reporting the EU course has special sessions dedicated to journalism
ethics, some of which are outlined below. At the heart of these values lies the European Union’s own charter on
fundamental rights, the Art 11 of which states that: “Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right
shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference
by public authority and regardless of frontiers. The freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected.”
In developed democracies, this allows individuals of every race and creed to express their opinions free from
censorship, providing those opinions do not contravene media-related laws such as defamation, contempt and
data protection and, when appropriate, issues such as incitement to racial hatred.
It should be borne in mind, however, that laws governing media freedoms vary from country to country and some
Neighbourhood partner countries are frequently criticised by international monitoring organisations for varying
degrees of censorship, repression and, in the worst cases, intimidation against the media.

### EDITORIAL GUIDELINES

TRUST

```
The relationship between a newspaper or a broadcasting station and its readers, listeners or viewers is based on
TRUST. It is like an unwritten contract: the reader buys the newspaper that he trusts. If it lets its standards fall,
then his trust diminishes and the reader buys a different newspaper, or looks elsewhere for his news.
An editor or producer tries to retain that TRUST by ensuring that the paper or channel’s journalism follows
a SET OF VALUES. The most important of these is ACCURACY, for who wants to buy a newspaper that is not
committed to accurately reporting the news?
Many other values are expected of good journalists. Usually they are expected to be BALANCED, reporting a
story from more than one point of view. Many journals and programmes expect IMPARTIALITY, meaning the
journalists does not reveal his own opinion about a story or ‘show his political colours’.
This becomes especially important at election time when the media sway public opinion and can collectively
influence the election outcome.
War reporting is another instance where the journalists needs to remember that his role is to report the war
not to fight it, thus he or she needs to show a high degree of OBJECTIVITY.
Other values that are often imposed, in the interests of retaining public TRUST, may include giving an accused
person a right of reply, protecting the children in the news from intrusion and being FAIR, which essentially
means not misreporting or denying someone a chance to respond to a news item which concerns them.
These values can be taken to a higher level where and when the story requires it. For example, in the field of
investigative journalism an editor would require his journalists to establish FACTS clearly before he agrees
to publish a story, especially if it makes an accusation. He would also normally give an accused person – or a
company or government department - the right to respond to any charge or accusation.
Most publications and broadcasters make these values part of their in-house CODE OF CONDUCT. In
democratic societies individual freedom of expression is an important human right. Freedom of the press and
broadcasting media is essential for the functioning of democracy.
As consumers of the media – readers, listeners or viewers – are never slow to point out, such freedom needs
to be exercised with responsibility. Codes of conduct provide ways to balance a newspaper’s freedom with the
responsibility it has towards its readers.
```

NEIGHBOURHOOD

This project is being delivered by a consortium

led by BBC Media Action.ACCURACY

```
Central to good journalism is getting the story right - and just as important, not getting it wrong or
misleading the public. ACCURACY is sometimes referred to as the fundamental value of good journalism.
Of course, one person’s truth can be another person’s lie, so it is sometimes hard for a journalist to
establish the truth. That can be especially hard in a war where each side has a very different point of view.
These are some of the guidelines towards achieving ACCURACY that newsrooms may impose on their
journalists:
```
- Where possible you should use more than one source for a story,
    indeed the more sources the better.
- Give the most weight to eyewitness accounts.
- Unconfirmed ‘facts’ should always be attributed – to prevent the newspaper or bulletin losing its
    audience’s TRUST if the information turns out to be wrong.
- It is the role of the journalist to check FACTS as thoroughly as possible, and only to report corroborated
    information.
- Journalists should VERIFY information where possible: uncorroborated information or questionable
    statistics should not be published or broadcast.
- It is better to be right than to be first – though a good journalist wants to be both.
- Always be alert to misinformation: if someone tells you something, ask yourself ‘Why is he telling me
    this?’ This applies as much to photographic or video material as to information.
- It is a cardinal error to mislead your audience or readership knowingly –
    and just as bad to do so unknowingly.
- The internet is a useful research tool but information found there is not necessarily accurate.
- Broadcast or published errors of facts should be corrected at the earliest opportunity.
Journalists are seekers after TRUTH. However it is not necessarily our role to establish the TRUTH, merely
to present different claims.
The skill of the journalist is to weight different points of view in an effort to get as close to the TRUTH as
possible. The public will TRUST a publication or programme that consistently gets its FACTS right.


NEIGHBOURHOOD

This project is being delivered by a consortium

led by BBC Media Action.INDEPENDENCE

```
Another important VALUE in journalism is that of INDEPENDENCE, usually taken to mean INDEPENDENCE
from political or commercial interests. In other words, decisions about what is published or broadcast are
taken entirely for editorial reasons: it is NEWSWORTHY or of interest to the audience.
Political parties are always keen to influence the media because they see it as a way to gain political
advantage. This is especially the case during an election campaign where they hope to use the media to
encourage people to vote in a certain way. Programme and newspaper editors go to great lengths to restrict
the influence of political parties.
A common rule is to say: We do not set out to influence the way people vote, only to present them with
choices.
It is undeniable that the media do influence the way people vote, but the important thing is that this should
not be deliberate, should not be the intent on the part of the programme or newspaper.
Similarly, commercial organisations may see the media as a way to increase sales of a product. To do this
by placing advertisements is legitimate, of course, but to try to influence a programme or news bulletin to
feature that product is not, especially if they try to buy that coverage.
Newspaper editors and programme makers are forever on the look-out for blatant or disguised ways to
influence the editorial decision making process. This is why they regard the value of INDEPENDENCE so
highly. This VALUE distinguishes true journalism from public relations or propaganda.
Readers, listeners or viewers are likely also to look for INDEPENDENCE when they buy a particular
newspaper or watch a programme. They accept that some programmes will be sponsored by certain
companies to promote their products. However, they expect this to be clearly stated so that they can allow
for this.
Most responsible television companies would not accept sponsorship for a serious news bulletin or
programme and newspapers would draw a clear line between paid advertising and news reporting
and analysis.
Thus the VALUE of TRANSPARENCY is just as important as INDEPENDENCE since it is the way editors
demonstrate to their readers and viewers that they have no ‘hidden agenda’.
The VALUE of INDEPENDENCE applies as much at the editorial level as at the individual level: a journalist
should not be influenced by his or her own personal political leanings or other personal interests. To do so,
would make them lobbyists on behalf of a cause rather than true journalists.
Editorial INDEPENDENCE means that journalists and their editors should report, record or write news and
other programme material free from pressure to ensure its ACCURACY, IMPARTIALITY and HONESTY.
For a newspaper or news bulletin, being ACCURATE is the best way to gain and retain readers’ or
audience’s TRUST’.
```

NEIGHBOURHOOD

This project is being delivered by a consortium

led by BBC Media Action.BALANCE AND IMPARTIALITY

```
Most stories have two sides to them – or more. The role of the journalists is to present both or all sides.
This may mean hearing from two different eye witnesses. If their stories corroborate each other you can be
reasonably sure it is factually ACCURATE.
More usually, versions do not entirely match each other having, quite literally, a different perspective on the
incident being described. It does not mean that one is telling the TRUTH and the other lying, merely that they
were standing in different places and saw the event differently.
It is a mistake to think that the role of the journalists is to decide which account is more accurate. That may
be the job of the police or a judge in a court of law. Being a good journalist requires only that we report both
versions and attribute them: ‘Witness A says this, Witness B says that.’
Many news organisations encourage their journalists never to take sides, nor to show which version they believe
to be more accurate. This is the value – and skill – of IMPARTIALITY or NEUTRALITY. It matters especially when
reporting politics. Our readers want to know what happened in a factual report; they are not interested which
side or political party the journalist favours. (That can be saved for an ‘opinion’ piece.)
Showing your own political colours may make your audience or readers TRUST your reporting less. Most
journalists take pride in not allowing their political feelings to get in the way of their reporting. That makes it even
more important that they report both (or all) sides of an argument – without of course taking sides.
A media outlet which publishes uncorroborated ‘facts’ or, worse, misinformation will soon lose the TRUST of its
readers/viewers/listeners. Most newsrooms have a series of procedures for separating TRUTH from rumours and
untruths.
Of course TRUTH is not absolute, so it may be a matter of presenting ‘facts’ from more than one point of view.
Imagine a car accident when drivers disagree about who was at fault. The reporter knows his role is not to decide
which of them is telling the TRUTH. It is to report both points of view, or even several points of view – several
different versions of the TRUTH, you could say.
This becomes more difficult when you are reporting countries or factions at war when the journalists can be
confronted with different versions of history, for example. His objective should remain the same: to report both
or all versions.
Remember, the trust of your audience depends very largely on ACCURATE and BALANCED reporting.

### REPORTING THE EUROPEAN UNION –

### ADDITIONAL TIPS

```
During the Reporting the EU workshops, trainees have been provided with tips to try and avoid some of the
pitfalls that can befall all reporters.
```
AVOID TECHNICAL LANGUAGE AND JARGON

```
Officials from the EU and other institutions often speak using language that is specific to their sector but
can be baffling for members of the public.
Such language can also often be found on official EU documents. The job of a journalist is to simplify, or demystify
technical language, or jargon, by using alternative words that can be understood by ordinary people.
Sometimes you will need to explain phrases that are not self-explanatory, such as “association agreement.”
If you are conducting an interview for inclusion in a news report and an official uses technical language you
may need to politely ask him, or her, to answer the question using clear and understandable language.
```
```
VIEWERS/LISTENERS/READERS OFTEN DO
NOT KNOW AS MUCH AS YOU DO.
```
```
Most viewers, listeners and readers will not have the detailed and specialist knowledge of the subject that
you have acquired. It is therefore important for each and every story to have just enough (though certainly
not too much) background information to put the audience in the picture. Getting the right balance of
current and background information is one of the many skills required by the successful journalist. In order
to provide the necessary background, it is important that journalists covering the EU are fully conversant
with the nature and functions of EU institutions, its modus operandi and the key personnel.
```
ENGAGE THE AUDIENCE

```
EU stories are often presented in an abstract fashion. Many journalists are guilty of this. One way to make
the stories more appealing and relevant is to assess the effect that an EU initiative or decision will have on
ordinary people’s lives and then explain that at the beginning of the story, preferably in the top line (first
sentence of the story).
```

NEIGHBOURHOOD

This project is being delivered by a consortium

led by BBC Media Action.HUMANISE YOUR STORIES

```
A story always has more impact if you illustrate it with a human example, or case study. Another way to
humanise stories is by using vox pops (series of juxtaposed reaction clips from several people). However,
vox pops should only be used if the subject is so broad that virtually everyone in the high street is affected
by it and it should be always born in mind that they are not a scientific gauge of public opinion and it is only
a snapshot.
```
ILLUSTRATE YOUR STORIES

```
Many EU stories originate from statements made by politicians, or officials, in public meetings or press
conferences.
In television, if you use pictures from press conferences, or meetings - which is all too common - you
deprive the audience of real pictures, thus minimising the impact of your medium. If the story is about
refugees, use pictures of camps, border crossings and other images relevant to the subject instead of tedious
and uninspiring shots of the meeting. This is especially important at the beginning and at the end of the
report. For radio, use the audio equivalent of pictures – natural sound, or actuality - to build up relevant
images in the minds of your audience.

### ETHICS AND PROFESSIONALISM IN

### ONLINE MEDIA

CREATING ATTRACTIVE CONTENT ONLINE

```
As online media production is rapidly gaining ground and the Internet is becoming the major source of information
for many people and the only source of information for the younger generation, producing attractive online content
and being able to reach a wide audience is becoming ever more important. The competition for the attention of the
audience is huge, so writing a good story or making a good interview alone do not guarantee “views” or ‘’hits’’. It is
essential that successful online journalists develop skills to produce attractive content using the available technology
and combining creatively text with video, audio and photos taking into account the specifics of multimedia production
and the models of viewing behaviour of the audience. Text, video and pictures work differently when posted online;
copying an article written for the press and adding some photos to it does not usually make an interesting read online.
Television reports uploaded onto the Internet do not attract a lot of attention either – multimedia online journalism
requires re-writing and re-editing the original texts, making them interactive and finding creative ways to make sure
the readers find them easily on their computers or mobile devices. The sections below offer some interesting and free
tools that can help produce more attractive online content.
```
```
Tools to create interactive online content:
```
WORKING WITH STILL IMAGES:

```
Still images enhance every story; according to audience research more than 65 % of viewers are attracted to a
story online by its photos. Making good photos and being able to perform some basic editing on them is one of
the basic requirements for online journalists today. Here are some tips on tools you may want to use to improve
your images and make them interactive:
Thinglink (Interactive images) helps link text, video, hyperlinks, maps etc. to a specific object on a still image and
make it interactive.
PicMonkey (Photo editing) is abasic photo editor which has most of the functions of other editing software but is
free and very easy to use.
Fotor (photo editing and collages) is another free option for basic editing and combining images.
SoundSlides (audio slideshow tool) is a tool which helps turn photos into an audio-visual story.
```
WORKING WITH SOUND:

```
Editing, uploading, interviewing and other relevant sound possible online in many different ways and enhance a
story by giving it authenticity and emotion. The following tools help edit, upload, share and find interesting audio
content for online publications:
Soundcloud (sound sharing) is for basic editing, uploading and sharing of audio.
Audioboo (sound sharing), in addition to sharing, offers access to thousands of audios and online solutions for
broadcasters.

```
The Internet offers various ways of finding and using music to complement or to tell a story; unfortunately
pirating music is still among the most common. Using pirated music is against the law. Additionally, the usage of
pirated content undermines the integrity of the whole piece and may hurt the trust of the readers in the content.
The two links below provide a legal and free alternative to pirated music:
Creative Commons Music
mobygratis
```
WORKING WITH DATA AND CHARTS:

```
As data journalism is making rapid headway, developing basic skills for attractive and interactive online
presentation of data is becoming a part of the requirements for successful multimedia reporters. The Internet
offers many user-friendly and free tools for visualisation of data like:
Datawrapper (opensource data tools)
Piktochart (free to use data visualisation themes)
```
WORKING WITH VIDEO:

```
Video online differs significantly from video for television; posting a TV package online will not attract as many
viewers as developing a more user-friendly video format. For example, stories can be much longer than the
regular television spot and include pieces which could not be shown on television because of time constraints.
Such videos should be thematically broken into the relevant segments with the appropriate intro. Another option
is to make videos interactive, as with:
Popcorn – Mozilla (including “layers” of additional information to the video activated by a click on the frame)
In every case, videos for online and mobile need to be compressed to speed up uploading and make viewing easy
on any speed Internet connection. There are various ways of doing that – like:
mpegstream clip (free video compression tool) etc.
```
WORKING WITH SOCIAL MEDIA:

```
Social media is being used in today’s multimedia journalism at every step of the production and distribution
process – from newsgathering through editing and verification to online promotion and distribution. Here we
focus on two useful tools:
Storify (storytelling with social media) turns social media content into an integrated story for online publishing.
Useful guide on SEO (Search Engine Optimisation): a detailed overview of the requirements your online activity
should meet in order to help search engines (and readers) find your content in the multitude of information
available on the Internet.

### MEDIA MANAGEMENT - FINANCIAL

### AND PROFESSIONAL INDEPENDENCE

### OF THE MEDIA

THE MANAGEMENT MIX

```
Media management and the financial and professional independence of the media encompass an
extraordinary mix of skills and knowledge across many different fields: editorial management, content
production process, professional audience research, marketing, financial management, human resources
management and cross platform-integration of media. Further complications are added in the countries in
transition of the Southern and Eastern European Neighbourhood by the distorted and heavily manipulated
media markets, the unclear structure of media ownership, the heavy handed and politically biased regulatory
processes and other factors which render media management even more challenging and raise serious
questions about the prospects of financial and professional independence of numerous media outlets.
```
THE SPECIFIC CHALLENGES

```
Many of the media management challenges in these countries are beyond the media managers’ or editors’
control: poor regulatory frameworks, problems with the implementation of the media legislation, political,
commercial and other special interest control over the media outlets, distorted advertising market, huge
influence of foreign media, etc. These issues determine to a large extent the environment in which media
organisations strive to prosper in most of the European Neighbourhood countries. In spite of a very
different context, the world media management expertise and standards are relevant and applicable. They
can help media managers and editors produce better content, serve better their audiences and work
towards the sustainability of their respective outlets.
```

NEIGHBOURHOOD

This project is being delivered by a consortium

led by BBC Media Action.THE BASICS

```
Some basic principles of media management apply across the board to the majority of media managers and senior editors.
The same principles apply equally to state-owned and commercial media outlets and to traditional and new media.
```
- General management issues: Management in any environment includes planning, organising, staffing, leading,
    monitoring and motivating people. Planning is about deciding what needs to be done in order to achieve
    the organisation’s objectives. Organising is about establishing the internal structures and relations within
    the organisation which will allow the successful implementation of the plans. Staffing is about choosing and
    recruiting the right people to meet the organisation’s needs. Leading is about organising and receiving the
    support of the staff in order to achieve the organisation’s goals. Monitoring is the process of following the
    progress against the established goals. Motivation is about providing staff with a strong internal reason to
    strive to achieve the organisation’s objectives.
- Understanding audiences is the starting point of any meaningful media production. The audience is the
    marketplace for the realisation of the media product, so knowing the market and being able to provide a high
    quality product is essential to the success of a media enterprise. Managers use a variety of tools to research
    the audience. Specialised agencies are used to conduct audience research for media producers, distributors
    and advertisers. In many cases media companies combine external audience research with internal tools to
    measure the response of the audience to the media production.
- Managing the content production process: Managers face the challenge of how to organise the process of
    news and information gathering, media content production, content distribution and marketing. The content
    production process has to achieve the planned audience results in an economically viable way, which is ever
    more important in an environment of rapidly growing competition and shrinking advertising revenues.
- Business planning is a major management tool which helps managers steer their operations towards the
    established goals of the organisation. It encompasses all major aspects of the planning process starting from the
    strategy to specific production plans, marketing, finance, operations and human resources management plans.
- Human Resource Management: This is the aspect of media management responsible for the recruitment,
    professional development, training, evaluation, and rewarding media professional and company staff in general.
    In the current media environment, being able to attract and keep top level media professionals is a growing
    challenge. Media organisations pay special attention to decreasing talent turnover and preserving their ability
    to produce unique and competitive media content.
- Internal and External Communications is of key importance for the achievement of its overall objectives
    and keeping the staff involved with the common production effort. Quite often media organisations could
    improve their external communications – the top management does not always understand the reason why a
    media organisation would benefit from professional media and public relations.
- Integrating content production across platforms is a common challenge for most traditional media companies
    at a time when a significant portion of the audience migrates to online media companies. They are struggling to
    develop an effective technology of content production and distribution across the different available platforms.


NEIGHBOURHOOD

```
The starting point of any media production is to understand the audience. The most valuable commodity any
media outlet has is the trust of its audience. Selecting and growing the target audience of the media outlet is
the ultimate goal of any manager. Defining your target audience allows you to create your own space within
the existing choice of alternatives offered by your competitors. In the age of new media your competitors
are a variety of other organisations: governments, NGO’s, the entertainment industry, citizen activists, social
networks, etc. In the case of a large corporation, the current successful model seems to be concentration of
communications, technology, entertainment and the production of a vast variety of media outlets targeting
different niche audiences. The Institute of Media and Communications Policy, a German think-tank provides a
comprehensive list of the World’s top 50 media outlets by annual revenue for 2013. The top five among them
have bigger annual budgets than half of the countries in the European Neighbourhood. All of them own a variety
of distribution channels of different sizes targeting specific audiences and maximising their reach by providing
specific products to satisfy specific audience needs. In the case of a small outlet, the best strategy seems to be
focusing on a well-defined target audience and becoming its major provider of trustworthy information.
When deciding about the production of a media product managers analyse the demographics (age, gender,
income, geographical location etc.) and the psychographics (activity, interests, opinion, attitudes, values and
behavior) of their target audience. Major tools for this analysis are the Representative Audience Surveys, which
are not always available in the Neighbourhood countries. Managers in the majority of these countries complain
that there is no reliable media surveying and have to resort to alternative ways of measuring their audiences.
Here are some of the available free or affordable tools: in-house Focus Groups, attaching media questions to
omnibus surveys, SurveyMonkey, FreeOnlineSurveys, StatCounter, QuantCast.

```
The business plan is a management tool. Many of the practical sessions during the project’s training sessions
were dedicated to discussing the pros and cons of having one. There is no such a thing as a business plan
template and the content of a business plan may vary significantly from another. Here are a few items you
may want to include in yours.
```
- Vision
- Mission
- Values
- Objectives
- SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities
    and Threats)
- Analysis
- Strategies
- Goal (download a SMART Goals Template here)
- Present Status
- Progress to Date
- Sales & Marketing
- Operations
- Finances
    - Product Description
    - Target Market Profile
    - Market Analysis
    - Competition
    - Customers
    - Market Size, Sales & Share Projections

    - Administration
    - Key Assumptions
    - Income Statements

The content of the individual organisational policy will inevitably vary from one organisation to another depending
on the size, country, local regulations, etc. The main point of having such regulations in writing is to make sure all
employees are aware of the policies and have a clear reference point when facing a specific potential conflict or a
controversial situation.

```
With the development of multiplatform journalism most of the media organisations are integrating their newsrooms
in order to produce and distribute content simultaneously via traditional and new media platforms – Television, Radio,
Online, Print, Mobile, Social Media etc. The “integrated newsroom” has gone through three different stages:
```
- Multi - Platform Newsroom
    There are separate platform content producers with separate editors, separate newsgathering and
    separate workflows. One editor coordinates all platform producers.
- Multi - Media Newsroom
    This approach is recognisable by the “Superdesk”: a round table of separate editors for each platform,
    coordinated by a “conductor” with joint newsgathering and workflow.
- Integrated Newsroom
    The most recent level of integration features fully integrated planning, gathering and production process,
    no separate editors or staff for the “platforms” and full integration of production and workflow across
    the media organisation.

of senior journalists from each partner country in the Neighbourhood area work closely with participants on the
Reporting the EU, Multiplatform and Election workshops to help develop EU-related content across print, broadcast
and online media. The mentors advise the participants, or mentees, on issues as diverse as story selection, story
content and structure, media law and ethics throughout the story production process.

### REDA FHELBOOM

### LIBYA

```
Since joining the BBC Media Action-led Media Neighbourhood Project in
November 2012, my skills as a journalist have been improving steadily.
Thanks to the workshops organised and run by BBC Media Action, I
committed to self-education and self-development alongside my mentoring
duties which are about helping others to progress, building relations with
them, encouraging, stimulating and motivating them to work together and
individually and share experiences and knowledge.
Attending the training session held in Tunis in August 2013 gave me
an opportunity to meet mentors from other countries and exchange
information and establish professional contact with them. We exchanged
telephone numbers and e-mail addresses. We agreed on a methodology for
the mentoring process and have worked ever since along the same basic
principles. This training session not only gave me the opportunity to meet
mentors, but to learn from them, therefore strengthening my skills and my
knowledge of the mentors’ duties and ‘’mission’’ - which from time to time
require some adjustment.
In September 2013, I contacted the mentees - from different backgrounds
```
- by emails and we agreed on a group meeting in a quiet café in a hotel
where we had a preliminary discussion. We discussed the projects and
agreed on dates, objectives and methods. Keeping in touch regularly with
the mentees, answering their queries methodically, giving them specific
support, assistance and advice for their professional project is a faire
description of a mentor’s duties.
In October 2013, a two hour meeting with the majority of the mentees
took place at the National TV where the articles/reports of the mentees
where assessed. The discussion focused on their achievements but also
their difficulties – including logistics. Assistance was given to mentees to
access sources related to the topics they set out to cover professionally.
Most of the mentees completed the I-learn modules, the BBC’s online
training platform and worked concomitantly on their assigned TV reports.
My personal experience as a Media Neighbourhood mentor has been
very beneficial for both the mentees and myself in terms of professional
contacts, channels of communication, learning new skills, networking
opportunities, organizational capacity and management. Our exchange of
experiences enables us to discover skills which were not used in the Libyan
media before.

For young journalists, participating in the Media Neighbourhood project
is an opportunity to get new knowledge and skills from experienced
BBC journalists, find out information and important data about the
workings of the European Union, stay in touch with mentors, which
enables them ask any question and advice regarding their work. It is also
a possibility to share experience with a geographically very widespread
community of journalists and media professionals. My advice for mentors
and their mentees:
```
```
Create Internet communities for better
communication
```
```
Create a Facebook group. This is particularly useful. Any mentor can ask
a question which they need answers to and then a discussion can take
place on how to improve the quality of the article/report (I remember
a heated discussion through the Facebook page on the feasibility of
producing high-quality coverage in a short space of time away from the
office. For a mentor, having an Internet group he shares with his mentees
is also a possibility to disseminate important information in real time
and keep the dialogue going.
```
Set objectives

```
Mentees who have a goal, therefore motivation, produce better results
Each mentee sets his/her own goals and defines his/her participation
in the project. Some need to be exposed to new experiences/practices
and acquire new knowledge and skills, others will benefit more from
practical advice about their own work.
The co-operation with a mentor has to have a purpose.
The mentoring programme can enable young media professionals to
work on his weaknesses with the help of an experienced and more
seasoned journalist. Progress, improvement and acquisition of skills are
definitely the best incentives. Motivation can also be created by practical
tasks and professional challenges. The follow up training with BBC
journalists, where their work is assessed and analysed is particularly
useful.
```
Design your own work plan and set deadlines

```
For a more positive experience and productive results, mentees should
be encouraged to come up with their own schedules and work plans;
setting deadlines is essential.

### KHEMAIS ARFAOUI

### TUNISIA

The “Mission” is no longer impossible!

```
A free and professional press is a sign, among many others, which enables
us to evaluate any democratic experience anywhere. The freedom
enjoyed by a professional, pluralistic and objective press is a guarantee
for democracy, freedom of expression as well as one of the citizens’ basic
human rights.
The press plays a crucial role in the promotion and the broadening of the
democratic process in society. This role seems to be even more pivotal
in a democratic transition phase, as it is currently the case in Tunisia, and
in various countries in the MENA region, as a result of a revolution and
a quest for a new and better deal, more democracy, more freedom and
general well-being.
```
The question is how to achieve this?

```
Democracy is a continuous practice both at the political level and in the
daily life of citizens.
Democracy is not only a value and a concept; it has to form part of a
whole system. It must be taught, enlarged, sustained, safeguarded and
protected on a daily basis.
The media are on the frontline and have to play a major role in this
context.
They have a noble and vital mission to fulfill in the education of democracy
and the establishment of the democratic practice.
Are the Tunisian media capable “now and here” to accomplish this mission
rapidly and efficiently?
It is not an easy task; it is rare gift, but not an impossible mission.
The Tunisian media do not lack professional journalists, but they have been
hindered by a deficit of practice of the professional journalistic exercise
for a long time.
And this is precisely why, the Tunisian media could be compared to a child
who is not a baby anymore and who has to learn how to walk, or to a
prisoner who spent many years in his cell and who is suddenly released
from jail. In both cases, the progress is not going to be rapid and easy;
```

NEIGHBOURHOOD

This project is being delivered by a consortium

led by BBC Media Action. there will be disappointment on the way before the child can walk with

```
confidence and the prisoner adapts to his new life.
What is required is willpower, courage, support and patience in order to
succeed.
Clear objectives have to be set.
As democracy is being built, free and developed media are also being
established.
It is high time for the Tunisian media to return to the professional ethics
and references, to be acquainted again with professionalism.
The moment has come for journalists to exercise their profession, their
passion, the job they chose, studied and love. This is what I am trying to do
daily when I am working and this is what I say to my colleagues and insist
on, in order to contribute to the democratic transition.
Therefore, for a successful transition we ought to be practicing the only
acceptable form of journalism, a professional one and a free one. This can
only happen when credible, accurate, objective and honest information is
published, the sort of information which reflects the different opinions and
political sensitivities.
This sort of journalism is necessary for the well-being and development of
the entire country and all its components.
Also, media professionals have to regain the lost confidence of the
Tunisian public towards the media as a whole; the only way to achieve
that is through journalistic responsibility and professionalism, through
professional and responsible journalism.
The state institutions and the law need to guarantee the emergence of
free and pluralistic media all through the democratic transition process.
It is definitely a challenge, but Tunisian journalists do not lack the will and
the know-how to achieve this objective.
We have no option but to raise to the challenge.
The “mission” is now possible.

### LUDMILA BARBA

“If you are informed, you are armed.”

```
I launched my own television project, “The European Vector” on
Moldova-1 Public TV almost 10 years ago, in June 2004. Back then,
people in Moldova hardly ever mentioned the European Union. Even
MP’s and government officials did not really know the difference
between the Council of Europe, the European Union and the European
Council.
I gradually learned about the European Union’s history, structure
and policies, but the European Union remained very distant and
inaccessible. What helped us draw closer to Europe was a year-long
training organised by the Institute for Public Policy in Moldova (www.
ipp.md) in cooperation with the German Institute “InWEnt” (InWEnt -
Capacity Building International and several trips to Brussels.
Theoretical and partial knowledge about the European Union and
producing reports for television programmes are two different things.
Because of poor funding of Moldova’s Public Television and Radio there
was zero opportunity for a television crew to be sent to Brussels or
any European Union member-state. I looked for sources of information
containing a video library or video materials. One of the main web-
sites I found was
http://www.europa.eu and the Audiovisual section:
http://europa.eu/newsroom/audiovisual/index_en.htm. Journalists
will find numerous resources on this site, including the European
Commission channel – EbS (Europe by Satellite)
http://ec.europa.eu/avservices/ebs/schedule.cfm. All materials from the
library and live broadcasts are available free of charge, on condition
that they are not used for commercial purposes.
The most recent example of how EbS helped Moldova’s national
broadcaster to be ahead of the game was during the 3rd Eastern
Partnership Summit in Vilnius when Moldova signed the Association
Agreement with the European Union. Moldovans, more than 1,200
km from the Lithuanian capital, could witness this historical event,
the ceremony and the speeches. Out of more than a hundred national
and regional channels registered in Moldova, only two carried live
broadcasts. One of them was a private channel that had an agreement

All European Union institutions have well developed and well equipped

with European Union, but bear in mind that it is practically impossible
to get an interview for the same day or the
following day.

the largest wave of European Union expansion, on 1st May 2004,
when 10 countries joined the European Union. Video-information on
cooperation between Europe and its neighbours is available here:

as the Mediterranean Union countries. Journalists from the European
Neighbourhood countries will find the Glossary on:

The European Union has a rotating presidency system: each member-
country takes over the European Council presidency for six months
and comes up with an action plan which defines priorities in various
fields, including foreign policy. Useful information is available on the
web-pages of the country which holds the presidency. The address is
always the same, only the domain changes. For example:
http://www.eu2013.ie - Irish presidency, http://www.eu2013.lt - Lithuanian
presidency, http://www.eu2015.lv - Latvian presidency, etc.
It is impossible to mention all the information made available for
journalists in one article; the information platform is vast. The task can
be rather daunting but never give up; you will find what you are looking
for. I have been a regular user for the past decade!

### SUZY EL-GENAIDY

### EGYPT

When I first started as a journalist in 1980, I wished I had benefitted
from training and guidance by colleagues who were experienced. It is
for this very reason that I am determined to help those who are new
in this job. This is mainly why I am so enthusiastic about this training
programme, funded by the EU and run by BBC Media Action. Over the
past few months, I have done my best to assist eight mentees, all young
journalists.
The choice of a topic is obviously the starting point but it can be a
delicate and sensitive process. We have to spend time on style and on
the different possible journalistic formats: stories, reports, investigation
and/or news analysis. News reporting requires transmitting the
information in the most concise way avoiding repetition, choosing
the right title, including the essential information, answering the right
questions (when, who, where, why and how) checking and mentioning
the source or protecting it. In the Egyptian press, news are often
attributed to unknown sources which are often wrongly labelled as
‘’informed source’’. It is also important to explain the background and
the circumstances in which the information was obtained. It is not
unusual for journalists to pretend that statements were made to them
exclusively when in actual fact it was made to a group of journalists
during a press conference for instance. Journalists must be reminded
that they should not include their personal opinions in their articles/
reports.
A report can be taken from international and/or local news agencies;
in that case the style should be adapted in order to serve a different
purpose.

NEIGHBOURHOOD

This project is being delivered by a consortium

led by BBC Media Action. Investigative journalism has sometimes its own specific rules; it also

```
requires a different style and must include specialised sources who can
give their opinions on the issue. The statements by the sources must
be clearly sign posted, must not be tampered with, even if they differ
from the reporter’s own views. I also explained the importance of using
simple language and a logic thread for maximum clarity. Among my
recommendations was the need to be clear as to what angle is going to
be covered, whatever the topic. Each individual journalist can of course
have his/her own personal style but the reader/listener/viewer should
never suffer and have to make an effort to understand the content.
A very useful piece of advice to the mentees is to make their stories
more human, how to write articles/reports that the public will find
attractive and relevant.
The mentees came to realise that thanks to sometimes long – but
fruitful - group discussions their contacts data base and their sources
are enriched. They can greatly benefit from their colleagues’ different
ideas and approaches.
Being a mentor requires a certain degree of patience and diplomacy;
the central part of the role is to motivate. I have personally benefited
from this experience in the same way as the mentees, and sometimes
even more, thanks to the new ideas submitted by young journalists and
discussing with them their opinions about current affairs. It was also a
great opportunity to meet fellow mentors from other Arab countries
and from Eastern Europe and that helped me to broaden my horizon
and understand better what’s happening in their respective countries.

‘’The objective is to give mentees opportunities, help them realise their
potential and the chance to improve their professional skills, by inviting
them to seminars and workshops, by offering guidance when they write
articles.
It is essential to create an atmosphere where all mentees feel they
are members of one team and a wider network, to encourage them,
suggest platforms and maybe help them to shine and be noticed for
their work.
Mentees are not students but nonetheless need proper feedback as
opposed to just recommendations.
This project has to be seen as a platform to improve their skills and
help them in their future and their career.
The primary task – after in-depth discussions and deliberations -
consists of identifying and prioritising interesting topics in order to
make their articles relevant.
Each individual journalist has his/her own style; only factual or ethical
errors should be corrected.
Mentees should be motivated to carry out interviews, practice
investigative journalism, write profile and test all formats.’’

The journalism work with mentees has been both quite complex and
intensive.
We worked on iLearn, the BBC online training system and we did the
first module together, using Skype conference to communicate. The topic
```
- Multimedia Journalism and Ethics was particularly relevant for all the
mentees in the group.
Some of them did not have experience in multimedia journalism, many
questions were asked on how to shoot videos, how to upload the
material on the web, how to take photos and how to use the sound bites.
Initially, the group met and discussed the general principles; for my part I
showed them how to prepare short videos and how to write texts.
Later on, when everyone started working on their own material,
individual meetings or online conferences were organised. In many cases
the reports were amended several times. The worked focused on content
and ethics. As a result, the majority of the mentees in the group managed
to produce entire reports and some of them were uploaded on the Media
Neighbourhood Facebook page. They overcame the main difficulty: how
to prepare a multimedia report with all the necessary ingredients.
The works on ethics proved to be more interesting, and all the basic
principles had to be re-visited. After several months of work, progress
was noticeable. Today, they are able to independently write and produce
multimedia material. Some of them continue to upload their stories on
their own blogs.
Mutually interesting was working on ilearn (the BBC online training
system): interviewing techniques, objectivity, investigative journalism and
numerous other issues. My advice to them were about sources, how to
protect them, how to get public information, etc.
The final and overall picture is positive. The vast majority of mentees
took the ilearn tests and obtained high scores. Progress is mainly
noticeable in standards of investigative journalism and ethical journalism.
iLearn created a lot of interest; after completing a module, they
demanded to start the next one!
As a conclusion, it is a very interesting and fruitful experience indeed for
mentor and mentees alike...

Europe and the Arab world

```
The image of Europe in the Arab mind has been created by “the clash of
civilisations” stereotype since the Middle Age. Twenty years ago that image
started to change as a result of a number of economic and social factors as well
as the improvement of communication channels.
However, the Arabs continued to see Europe as a colonizer aspiring to loot their
wealth or impose its culture and in the best scenario, Arabs saw Europe as a
remote continent, geographically and culturally, politically distant, mainly because
of the European countries stance regarding the Palestinian issue.
The 21st century started with positive steps enhancing optimism about the
opportunity of an encounter between those two worlds and a change in the
mutual traditional prejudices.
I take the view that a programme like the BBC Media Action-led Media
Neighbourhood project will have a positive impact in reshaping the relationship
between the North and the South.
As a mentor in this programme, I came to realise that Europe which is seen
as more developed and wealthier, is deploying important efforts to assist the
South to develop democratic values, encourage good governance and strengthen
institutions capable of improving people’s living standards, dignity and the
protection of their rights.
My advice to journalists involved in the programme is to investigate their stories
and to abandon their prejudices.
The public in the Arab world will benefit from better journalism. And if
journalists stick to facts they will contribute to the improvement of relationships
between both sides and will reduce the gap between North and South.
Cooperation between journalists to produce high quality reports/articles
focuses on investigating sources of information and enriching their contacts
database in order to gather useful and relevant information. So far, one of
the major difficulties has been to obtain information and data from official.
Journalists should in all circumstances seek multiple sources and avoid relying on
one single source.
My experience with this project has opened new perspectives for research and
providing assistance in reshaping the relationship between the Europeans and
the Arabs; it is definitely in the interest of both sides to have new ties, to rebuild
their relationship based on cooperation, understanding and mutual respect for a
new future.

```
I have been working as a mentor in this Media Neighbourhood project
for almost a year. This is a new and interesting experience for me.
Below are some examples of advice I have been giving to my mentees,
and hopefully, have been of useful professionally.
For example, in the case of interviews and the preparation stage, while
working to my mentees, I always share my experience and give them
advice. I explain the importance of researching thoroughly the topic of
the interview and previous interviews given by the interviewee. They
have to be ready for different scenarios, different answers, different
reactions, but most importantly they must prepare follow-up questions.
I also provide my mentees with background knowledge on the topic
of the European Union and its relations with Ukraine, which is my
specialist field. In Ukraine, there aren’t many journalists who have been
working on Europe on a daily basis and those who have, only started
quite recently. Unfortunately, some of these issues are misinterpreted,
journalists speculate instead of providing information based on facts -
sometimes deliberately. For instance, on the subject of the Association
Agreement with the European Union, some journalists said it would
lead to the legalisation of same-sex marriages or the cancellation
of the visa regime. I also help my mentee find more information on
Europe online and suggest experts who can be contacted on particular
subjects. As a result, the mentees produced solid output on European
topics.
Journalists should pay particular attention to accuracy, logic,
presentation, style, syntax and vocabulary. This is valid for all journalists,
not only print journalists.

Mentoring Tips

Establish Communication

```
The first step to take as a mentor is to establish communication with
the mentees. During the first meeting, their career and interests in
journalism have to be thoroughly discussed. Face-to-face meetings, at
least for the first time, produce better results.
When mentees are almost the same age as the mentor or even older, it
can cause additional difficulties. Whatever the circumstances, respect is
an essential element to establish trust and to communicate efficiently.
Mentees are not students. Topics and content have to be discussed,
commented and analysed in order to agree on what needs to be
improved and how it can be improved.
```
1. Motivate and Encourage

```
The iLearn online journalism educational tool plays an important part
in the process; all questions regarding iLearn need to be answered
clearly. The iLearn assignments should take at most one hour, but
mentees need to be motivated and encouraged in order to beat the
deadlines. Encouraging and motivating mentees is the main part of the
mentors’ ‘’mission’’. Mentees are active journalists and are always very
busy and need to be reminded of deadlines. Social networks, e-mails,
mobile phones are particularly useful to keep in touch and to remind
mentees of iLearn assignments and deadlines for articles and/or audio
reports.
```

NEIGHBOURHOOD

This project is being delivered by a consortium

led by BBC Media Action. 2. Assist and Advise

```
Mentees need assistance and advice to select a relevant topic and
angle. Because the project focusses on European Union related issues,
mentees tend to choose news stories which are too official and
therefore it proves extremely difficult to make them sound interesting
to the wider public, as it is the case for official visits or official reports.
It is essential to help them find more “human” stories or show how
some political decisions, projects or initiatives can bring about change
and have an impact – both negative and positive - on people’s everyday
lives.
Experience shows that the angle and the focus of a story create the
most interesting discussions as far as editorial principles and ethics are
concerned. Generally, topics are very wide, far too wide and the risks
of superficial reporting are high.
Other fascinating discussions take place regarding the ‘’right’’ choice of
footage for television reports - especially for the opening and closing
shots - the length of interviews which can make stories desperately
tedious. The structure of the report provides also an excellent
opportunity to cover important editorial issues, both in terms of script
and pictures.
```
3. Sustainability

```
The mentor-mentees relationship cannot and should not be based
on the promise of rewards. Mentors and mentees have to work as
colleagues and have to be
in touch on a regular basis in order to evaluate the journalistic skills of
everyone involved.

Media Neighbourhood Project is a valuable experience, where one,
besides learning, establishes worldwide connections, which are critical
and very important for sustainable cooperation, in the context of
globalized world, media and developments.
As a mentor, I had an opportunity to be acquainted with local Armenian
journalists, find new talents and colleagues and engage them into other
journalistic projects.
For example, one of the Armenian participants started to contribute as
a free lance journalist for IWPR’s Caucasus Reporting Service, where
I work as an editor from Armenia, on regular basis, since our first
meeting in the frames of Media Neighbourhood Project’s seminar in
Yerevan, in 2012.
Another participant from the Armenian group was engaged in an
initiative I was involved - in the Media Center, during election season in
Armenia in 2013, as a moderator and analyst.
It is a great advantage to be part of the Media Neighbourhood Project,
and to have access to human resources around the world.
When developments started to take place in Ukraine, regarding
Ukraine’s government’s decision not to sign Association Agreement
with European Union in Vilnus, Lithuania, I asked for help and
suggestions from my Ukrainian colleagues-mentors, who recommended
political analysts that could have been interviewed by Media Center
and Armenian journalists. As a result, Media Center organised a
discussion with participation of Armenian political analyst and a
Ukrainian expert, who joined us via Skype.
Media Neighbourhood Project enriches participants with knowledge,
information and with valuable contacts, enabling professional and
diverse journalistic experience. It is also a tool for sustainable
cooperation between media experts and journalists from different

NEIGHBOURHOOD

This project is being delivered by a consortium

- Be open for a feedback from trainers and colleagues regarding your
    journalistic work. Being defensive will not help you to improve
    professionally.
- Try out new techniques that you learn at workshops or from an
    interaction with your mentor on a daily basis in your newsroom.
    Everyday implementation of new skills will help you to progress
    faster. Share your knowledge with your colleagues, write about it in
    your blog or on social networks.
- Co-operate! Be aware that you are part of a huge network and
    that you can use your contacts in order to enrich your journalistic
    material with interviews, information and facts from around the
    world. If you are covering Syria, for example, do not forget that
    you have colleagues and mentors from Syria in this network.
    Contact them, engage with them and get first-hand information
    from a place you have no direct access to.
- There are many opportunities to get funding for investigative
    reporting projects or other media-related ideas. Think about it and
    if you have an idea, broaden your horizon and take an international
    perspective and remember that you are part of a huge network
    where you can find colleagues who will be interested in taking part
    into a joint project. Share your ideas with them and engage with
    colleagues from other countries and regions for the benefit of your
    projects. This will strengthen your project and will internationalise
    it. More people will learn about your activities, and you will
    therefore make a greater impact.

### OLHA MUSAFIROVA

### UKRAINE

```
Currently, Ukraine is going through milestone moments in its recent
history, when the role of the media is not simply about informing the
public on events in the country, Europe and the world or analysing
those events. Almost all national and regional media outlets (with
the exception of the governmental ones) are trying to educate their
readers/listeners/viewers. They are trying to tell them about euro-
integration and how it will influence their lives.
The media which approve the development of the Ukraine – European
Union relations limit themselves to running very generic stories on this
topic. They either cover meetings and negotiations at the top echelons
of Ukrainian authorities with their European Union counterparts, or
publish interviews with politicians who talk about macro-economic
cooperation and reforms, justice problems, struggle against corruption,
European values and democracy. In my opinion, they, themselves, do not
quite understand the nature of changes that need to take place in the
mentality of the post-Soviet and rather conservative Ukrainian society.
Stories are very often like a set of mottos and appeals not supported
by examples or facts and hardly comprehensible by the public at large.
As a result, the public’s feedback show that Ukrainians are ‘’connected’’
with Euro-integration mainly as consumers of potential benefits.
People seem to think that salaries and pensions will be increased
immediately and will be comparable to European levels, commodity
prices will drop, and believe they will be able to travel visa-free, etc.
Selective justice, a relevant and painful topic for Ukraine, which was
included into the so-called “Fuele List” (which contains conditions
that have to be met before Ukraine could sign the European Union
Association Agreement), is mostly presented to Ukrainians through the
prism of Yuliya Timoshenko’s case. Journalists hardly ever write about
other cases, especially in the context of compliance with European
justice’s standards. Those who end up behind bars are not those who
necessarily committed crimes, but those who cannot prove their
innocence without bribes or connections.
```

NEIGHBOURHOOD

This project is being delivered by a consortium

led by BBC Media Action. The political situation is of course a focal point of discussion with

```
mentees when it comes to choosing a topic to be covered. Euro-
integration often comes at the top of the list; unemployment is also
a priority and so are foreign investment projects. BNy and large the
public is interested in investigative journalism, for instance: Why can’t
foreign investors, foreign companies fully meet their commitments?
Journalists/reporters have to highlight the entire range of issues, and
sometimes, as a result, the main protagonists of the story might not
like the outcome of the investigation.
http://procherk.info/resonance/2-cherkassy-news/12279-cherkaschina-
vidljakue-investoriv/
Our experience and the public’s reaction show that media outlets
must cover issues that are geographically topical and relevant, analyse
local conflicts, use local examples to draw parallels with Europe. The
other conclusion is that the public trust journalists’ assessment and
reports when the reporters do not only quote documents or insider
information, but when they also describe what they see for themselves
in a lively style. It is hard to get officials to talk directly to a journalist,
especially if the officials are suspected of corruption - not only in
Ukraine but also in Europe. It is difficult but it does not mean it is
impossible or should not be done. The truth should come out.
As a mentor, I used my own investigation story “Chernobyl.
Background”,
http://www.novayagazeta.ru/society/56699.html which talks about the global
project “Shelter” at Chernobyl and the use of international donor
funds. The mentees should be encouraged to use persistently the law
on access to public information.
My participation in the project as a mentor stimulated me to
engage in self-education, as well as to develop partnerships with
young journalists, as we learn both from each other’s mistakes and
experience.

The Layout says a lot about you!

```
Think about having a sketch of the layout. A journalist must be able to
define his/her own layout. Although the journalist cannot technically
do that, it would be sufficient to provide the editing secretary with a
sketch of the layout. You must respect the number of signs for each
bloc and the already established menu. For example, you are preparing
a report on street children; the layout must be spaced. You committed
yourself to submit to the editing secretary a report that contains
a caption on updates, a short interview or statistics in the form of
graphics, you must make sure that the report is free from any other
loads, statements by officials, a spokesperson from an association,
figures, or reminders... you must make it easy for your readers. Attract
the reader, breakdown your piece but keep the logic thread. Remember
to involve all the editing team. The photographer (if you do not take
pictures yourself), can take expressive photos, shots that speak for
themselves. Discuss your plan with him/her and the layout technician
must implement what you have in mind. On the other hand, it is your
duty to take his/her recommendations into account. Very often, original
topics and good ideas fail to be identified because of a bad layout and
the journalist’s ‘’attitude of the journalist who focus his/her attention
on the text only. Be innovative.
```
Graphics! That’s even better!

```
Think about using graphics. There are some technical topics which are
complex and the challenge is to make them accessible to the readers
who by definition are not experts. Avoid texts, wherever possible use
graphics. Give all the details to your graphics specialist.
For example, in the case of teams that qualify for the World Cup, there
is no need for a traditional article, a graphic will be more relevant, and
the same can apply to a report on the cost of living..
```
Contacts, contacts, contacts

```
Journalists must realise the importance of a contact database. The
hardcopy of a contact list in alphabetical order might appear old-
fashioned but definitely does the trick. Do not be “embarrassed” in this
technological age to display one next to your smartphone..
```

This project is being delivered by a consortium

```
You have an idea... Do not hesitate to suggest it in the editorial
meeting. Whether original or not, make the suggestion and then you
will know where you stand after a discussion with your colleagues
and your editor. If you trust your editor, let him mentor you. Suggest
anything you like; your readers might be interested if the topic is made
relevant and covered accurately.
```
Short of ideas?

```
It happens! Do not seek complicated issues. Simple topics can make the
front page news. You may start by reviewing the press, reading various
articles covering daily events, statements by officials. Read between the
lines and you can be inspired, without necessarily doing a “copy and
paste” job or “re-heating” someone else’s article. For example, during
the whole week you read about a wave of suicides in many cities; see
what you can add, explore other angles. Another example: a statement
by a minister on the launch of 3G or 4G, think of the failures, the
impact, the repercussions. If you are short of ideas and you find only
emptiness around you, think of the possibility of investigating projects
announced by officials: where does the project stand?

I tell the mentees: “Stick to the Basics of
Journalism”
```
```
A few months after the launch of the BBC Media Action-led Media
Neighbourhood training programme, useful lessons have already been
learnt by mentors and mentees alike.
The majority of young journalists/reporters in Tunisia work in a
unfriendly, sometimes openly hostile environment. Most of them are
graduates from IPSI, Tunisia’s only and often criticized journalism
school.
The journalists who took part in the workshops organised in Tunisia
for early and mid-career media professionals were very satisfied with
the outcome, simply because they discovered practices, skills and ethics
they would otherwise have never discovered.
Most of them kept asking to be given the opportunity to take part in
other training workshops - a reasonable request it seems.
A journalist can take part in more than one training session covering
different themes and platforms, and the assignment they are given
means that the whole experience has real practical value.
It is obvious that the needs of the journalists based in the
headquarters of their media outlets - in Tunis, the capital city - are
on the whole very different from the needs and the backgrounds of
reporters who work in the regions, an element that must be taken into
account for the training approach and methodology.
```

This project is being delivered by a consortium

```
The public perceive journalists as incompetent and corrupt or simply
and accuse them to be creative with truth.
Many mentees have often asked me this very question: “How do you
define a good journalist?”
My answer has always been: “Forget about good or bad journalist, just
concentrate on good journalism”.
Most of the trainees have studied at the university for several years
and they have the theoretical and academic background to enable them
to become ‘’proper’’ journalists. I am convinced that they should be
sticking to the basics of journalism if they hope to become ‘’brilliant’’
journalists.
In order to answer their question, I always refer to 9 core principles of
journalism, as identified by PEW Research Journalism Project.
```
```
1. Truth is journalism’s first duty
2. The public is journalism’s first loyalty
3. The essence of journalism is to verify
4. Journalists must be independent
5. Journalists must make politicians accountable
6. Journalists must provide a forum for public debate
7. Journalists must stay in tune with the public and cover relevant
events
8. Journalists must provide comprehensive and balanced coverage
9. Journalists must be free to report without political interference or
pressure
