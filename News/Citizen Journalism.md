## Introduction

This toolkit presents accessible methods and techniques by which youth workers can introduce young people to the basic principles of citizen journalism and media literacy. Through carefully selected role-playing games combined with already developed methods to stimulate critical thinking, decision-making and teamwork, trainees will step by step enter into a deeper understanding of media literacy and citizen journalism and learn how to put into practice their main principles and elements.

The focus falls on building skills to search and process information, detect and recognise fake news, create content and distribute it through social media and other traditional channels. Special attention is paid to building leadership skills and communication with specific audiences, as well as the development of an ethical position on important societal topics and issues.

###### Why was this toolkit developed?

Sharing information and personal opinion is so easy in the age of social media that young people can easily get lost if they don't know the basic principles and ethical stance of journalism. Lightning access to information, on the one hand, facilitates the work of journalists, but on the other hand, it requires quite a bit of knowledge and skills to be able to navigate and understand which sources can be trusted and which not. Along this reasoning comes media literacy as one of the most important skills to navigate oneself nowadays. We can find information about everything online. This gives many opportunities but also hides many traps. We are flooded with a sea of all kinds of information, and we need media literate to learn how to swim in this broad sea of information.

A European approach to media literacy in the digital environment defines media literacy as the ability to access the media, understand and critically evaluate different aspects of the media and media contents and create communications in a variety of contexts. Thus, media literacy has never been as important as it is today. It enables people of all ages to navigate the modern news environment and take informed decisions for their communities. At the same time, it seems extremely easy for a young person to become the media and gain influence over a certain group of people. The problem here is that the awareness of the citizen journalists' responsibility to society requires a lot of experience and fieldwork before it becomes a basic principle for creating and disseminating information. On the other hand, young people are becoming more and more active and sensitive to the social and moral problems of the societies in which they live. The rise of activism and the growing number of young people with active citizenship lead naturally to the creation of opinion leaders.

The design of this toolkit is an attempt to make the path from the active civic position of young people to become opinion leaders and citizen journalists easier and more pleasant. The developed units are directly related to individual aspects of citizen journalism and develop the knowledge and skills necessary for training young people in this direction. In this way, by offering ideas and methods for developing these qualities and skills, the work of young workers and trainers will be organised in a comprehensive process of creating and developing professional skills.

Based on the experience of the creators of the toolkit and the best journalistic practices, it is offered step by step – from clarifying the basic theoretical concepts to the practical skills of judging and distributing news, interviews, reports and comments of the citizen journalist.

###### How is this toolkit organised?

This toolkit is structured into seven main topics, for which an online citizen journalism training course has also been developed. These topics are:

*   History and Definition of Citizen Journalism
*   Citizen Journalism as a tool for community engagement
*   Leadership, building audience engagement (personal branding of citizen journalist)
*   Fake news and disinformation – strategies for identification
*   Creating content online and reporting events
*   Active participation through online presence
*   Platforms, networks and user-created content

Each of these topics has a different number of training tools, developed as role-playing games for teamwork, which help to create the necessary knowledge and skills in different aspects of each topic.

The following items are presented for each of the games:

*   Skills and concepts targeted
*   Objectives
*   Materials needed
*   Tools, sources
*   Duration
*   Number of participants
*   Description
*   Debriefing questions
*   Handouts

For each of these games, methodical instructions are given to the trainer on how to prepare and conduct it in advance. Special attention is paid both to the necessary materials for their implementation and to their step-by-step process. Since individual games are of different durations and involve different numbers of participants, trainers can choose the number needed for their conditions so as to cover the most important elements of the respective topic in the most appropriate forms for the audience they are training.

## Definition and History of Citizen Journalism

In this topic, the theoretical framework is presented and the main concepts related to citizen journalism are introduced. In the form of role-playing games and through other methods, the participants in the training go through the mastery of the most important terms and their application. As citizen journalism is a relatively new concept and most of the local languages lack a local equivalent, some of the elements in this topic are related to conducting debates to clarify the historical context and contemporary application of citizen journalism.

The main task through the proposed elements in this topic is the in-depth understanding of the role of citizen journalism in modern society. Special attention is also paid to propaganda and the similarities and differences with the modern concept of citizen journalism.

### 1. Where Is My Truth

| **Skills and concepts targeted** | Digital literacy Fact-checking / source validation                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objectives**                   | To raise awareness on how messages are shared through social media <br> To highlight the need of checking the original source <br> To make participants internalise about the “loss of information” the more nodes are added between the message recipient and the original source |
| **Tools, sources**               | A predefined “statement” 1-2 sentences long about some social issue of concern / about a specific social group <br> E.g., *"America was indebted to immigration for her settlement and prosperity. That part of America which had encouraged them most had advanced most rapidly in population, agriculture and the arts."*                                      |
| **Duration**                     | 15-20 minutes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Number of participants**       | 20-40 people, age 16+                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**Description**

The participants are split into two groups and sit down in two circles. The trainer chooses two people from one of the circles (e.g., the circle on the right) and tells them, without letting the others hear, that their task is to change one word of the sentence they will listen to. This instruction is NOT given to the participants of the other circle.

The trainer (“original source”) thinks of a 1-2 sentence statement that has social implications (e.g., concerns a vulnerable group – Lgbqt+, ethnic/religious minorities, disabled, women, immigrants, public health, etc.). Then, the “original source” whispers the message above to a person in the circle on their left and to a person in the other circle on their right. Once one person from both circles gets the message, they need to whisper to the person on their left side within their circle.

The two people previously chosen (inside the right circle) will have to change something from the message (noun, pronoun, number, or adjective - it cannot be a minor word). Then, the next one repeats the process until the message arrives to the last person in both circles, who says the message out loud.

The “original source” then tells everyone the original message. The group then can discuss the difference between the two messages and the original one.

**Debriefing questions**

*   What do you think about the difference between the original message and the two final messages?
*   Have you noticed any differences in the message spread by the circle that was supposed to keep it identical to the original form?
*   Do you feel that the same thing that happened in the activity can happen on social media as well? Why?
*   Have you ever checked the sources of the information you get in contact with? If yes, how often do you do it?

**Description**

###### Preparation

Prepare one (or more) flipcharts where the key terms you want to introduce are written down without any other information. Give each term sufficient space so that 5-10 or more posts can be placed around them. Cut out the “puzzle pieces” out of the definitions puzzle, making sure that there are enough for the Number of groups you will create (2 false concept-definition pairs per group).

###### Part A – Basic Terms and Concepts

***Subpart 1: Keywords***

Divide the participants into small groups (2-3 people) and give each group 10-15 post-its (or as many definitions/concepts from the list you intend to introduce). If you will implement the *optional step*, you have to number the groups and the terms.

Show one of the words of the list on the screen and give participants 1 minute to brainstorm and write down words related to that concept. When the minute is over, continue with the next term. To avoid confusion, the participants should write the concept on top of the post-it, like a title.

After the same procedure is completed for all terms, ask participants to stick their post-its next to the respective concept on the flipchart. For each concept, read out loud all keywords associated with it

> **[!TIP] Tip for the facilitator**
> If you do not have sufficient time, instead of reading all keywords, tell participants to take a photo of the flipchart since they will need it for the next part.

***Subpart 2: Own Definitions***

Optional Step (if there is sufficient time; approx. 15 minutes): The members of each group have 5-6 minutes to discuss and define one specific concept from the ones already analysed in the previous part. Group No 1 defines concept No 1, Group No 2 - concept No 2 and so on. The definition has to be written down on a piece of paper. In the end, each group has to read their definition to the others.

***Subpart 3: The Definitions’ Puzzle***

Each group is given 2 false concept-definition pairs, already cut out from the Handout “Definitions’ Puzzle”. They have to go around to the other groups and trade their puzzle pieces so that they end up with two correct concept-definition pairs.

All groups who make it within 5 minutes win a “bigger prize” (e.g., a whole bar of chocolate per person).

All groups who make it within 10 minutes win a “smaller prize” (e.g., one chocolate bite, such as one Ferrero Rocher, per person)

Finally, all correct concept–definition pairs are presented to the whole group.

###### Part 2 – History and Characteristics of Citizen Journalism (20-30 minutes)

Continue with a short presentation introducing the concept of citizen journalism and its history in brief (10-15 min). You can use the contents of the first Module of the JOUR-YOU Online Course (Glossary, Infographics & Video) as the basis for your presentation.

After showing the Video, invite participants to do a short brainstorming, during which they have to name and briefly elaborate on the main characteristics of Citizen Journalism. Give your feedback and check whether all main features are mentioned and understood by the participants. The total duration of this part should be 10-15 minutes.

Alternatively (to save time), instead of implementing brainstorming, you may introduce the characteristics of citizen journalism in the first step (during the presentation).

<details>
<summary>Information for the facilitator: Characteristics of Citizen Journalism</summary>

1.  ***It is not profit-driven:** Unlike traditional journalism, the majority of citizen journalist activities are self-funded.*
2.  ***It is happening with no formal training:** No University offers a degree in citizen journalism.*
3.  ***It operates based on a decentralised, bottom-up process:** There are no citizen journalism headquarters, no chief executive officer, financial officer or marketing director. Citizen journalism is a movement without any visible or unseen substructure at work.*
4.  ***It allows unprecedented levels of polyphony:** Average citizens can be active participants in creating and spreading news and information, allowing for a much greater diversity of opinions and expertise to become accessible by everyone than in traditional journalism.*
5.  ***Citizen journalism is happening with no fixed standards of formation or editing:** Both broadcast and print media require journalists to conform to certain standards, concerning grammar, spelling, writing styles, etc. They also have high standards for sourcing, quoting, privacy, etc. Citizen journalists operate outside of all these restraints.*
6.  ***Citizen journalism has a high degree of immediacy:** Unobstructed by traditional structures or editing processes, citizen journalists can be more mobile and responsive to breaking news than traditional journalists.*
7.  ***Citizen journalism broadens the content published by traditional media:** With the Internet and social media, sharing information has never been easier, while citizens as a group do not have some hidden or specific agenda. Thus, citizen journalism covers topics that are sometimes overlooked by the mainstream media, this way enhancing pluralism in the media.*
8.  ***Citizen journalism contributes to the democratisation of society:** Citizen and other independent media not only inform people but critically question various problems and make governmental actions more transparent. This is especially important when it comes to censorship.*

</details>

**Debriefing questions**

*   Do you think that the activity was useful to discover terms and concepts related to Citizen Journalism?
*   Was it difficult to understand which was the correct definition?
*   So, after all this process, can you name some things that a citizen journalist typically does?

<details>
<summary>For the facilitator (indicative answers for the last question)</summary>

Citizen journalists are independent, freelancing citizen news and opinion reporters. They are not constrained by conventional journalistic processes or methodologies, and they usually function without editorial oversight. They gather, process, research, report, analyse and publish news and information, most often utilising a variety of technologies made possible by the Internet. They don’t just write a letter to the editor and hope it gets printed. Instead, they may:

*   Write a blog.
*   Email everyone in their address book.
*   Develop a local news website.
*   Have a regular presence on `Twitter`, `Facebook`, `YouTube` or other platforms to comment on, inform about and sensitise to topics of major concern for the local community.
*   Text message people they hope to influence.

<summary>Handout: Definitions’ Puzzle</summary>

*(Note: The intended activity involves matching concepts with their correct definitions. The table below presents the correct pairings based on the numbering provided in the original document.)*

| Concept                      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Citizen Journalism (1)**       | It is the phenomenon in which the audience (people who are not professional journalists or trained reporters) employs the press tools they possess to inform one another; become contributors to the media, using many different forms of distributing information. Also known as network journalism, participatory journalism, Web 2.0 journalism, collaborative journalism, and guerrilla journalism. |
| **Community Media (2)**          | It is a tool which is owned and controlled by the community in response to local needs as it puts “more focus on participation and openness often showing the ability of non-professionals to organise media production themselves”.                                                                                             |
| **Citizen Advocacy Journalists (3)** | A genre of mainstream journalists that adopt a viewpoint for the sake of advocating on behalf of a social, political, business or religious purpose and adapt their reporting work accordingly. What makes their work journalism instead of propaganda is the use of supportable, independently verifiable facts that support the presuppositions of the writer, publication, blog or website. These journalists admit their biases to their audience and freely write or speak their opinions. |
| **Accidental Journalists (4)**   | People who are caught unexpectedly in the middle of an event and take photos or videos and upload them to either social networking websites such as Facebook, MySpace or Twitter, or news websites such as CNN’s iReport or Fox News’ uReport.                                                                                        |
| **Polyphony (5)**                | A characteristic of citizen journalism: Average citizens can be active participants in the creation and spreading of news and information, allowing for a much greater diversity of opinions and expertise to become accessible by everyone than in traditional journalism.                                                         |
| **Immediacy (6)**                | A characteristic of citizen journalism: Unobstructed by traditional structures or editing processes, citizen journalists can be more mobile and responsive to breaking news than traditional journalists.                                                                                                                          |
| **User-generated content (7)**   | Text, images, videos, audio, or other forms of presenting information, that are created by individuals who are not necessarily professional creators or affiliated with the platform that hosts that information. Rather, they are created by ordinary people who are using the platform for their own personal or professional reasons. The most common examples are social media posts, blog articles, reviews, comments, and ratings. |
| **Misinformation (8)**           | This is the term we use for false information published due to unintentional errors. This can be republished unverified information that does not correspond to the truth, reference to satirical media as sources of serious information, or unintentional mistakes in names of people, places, pictures or mistaken statistical information. |
| **Disinformation (9)**           | is false content disseminated with the primary purpose of causing harm to an individual, an institution, a country or specific social groups. It is used as a basic tool in propaganda. To conceal this technique, real persons or organisations are cited as the source of content without it being true.                          |
| **Malinformation (10)**           | is deliberately published personal information intended to cause harm to a person or institution. This may be done by altering parts of the information, such as the time, place or context in which it originated.                                                                                                              |
| **Audience Engagement (11)**      | This is a blanket term for: How interested your audience is in your content. How much do they “take part” in your content (via reading, watching, commenting, etc)?                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Civic Leaders (12)**            | People who make the lives of others better by using their knowledge, skills and time. They are actively involved in improving the welfare of their communities and addressing social, economic, and political issues, either through elected or appointed positions or through voluntary work.                                   |
| **Opinion leaders (13)**          | Individuals who exert a significant amount of influence within their network and who can affect the views of connected individuals. They may emerge in a variety of contexts, including politics, business, social movements, and media.                                                                                       |
| **Crowdsourcing (14)**            | The practice of turning to a body of people to obtain needed knowledge, goods or services. Businesses, individuals and organisations of all kinds have used this process to solicit ideas and raise money as well as consolidate and promote information. Many citizen journalism platforms also implement this practice.            |
| **Online presence (15)**          | The existence in digital media through the different service systems available on the Web. It is the representation of a person or a company on the internet through social networks, trading, email and video.                                                                                                                  |
| **e-Participation (16)**          | Refers to the use of digital technologies and communication tools to enable individuals and communities to engage in a range of activities related to decision-making, governance, and public policy. Its objective is to improve access to information and public services as well as to promote engagement in policy-making, both for the empowerment of individual citizens and the benefit of society as a whole. |
| **Community engagement (17)**     | Refers to how individuals and groups work together to address issues and improve the quality of life in their community. This can include activities such as volunteering, participating in community-building events, and working with local organisations to address community needs. It can also be seen as a way to build social capital, which refers to the networks, norms, and trust that facilitate cooperation and coordination within a community. |
| **Civic Engagement (18)**         | Individual and collective actions designed to identify and address issues of public concern. This type of active participation is more politically oriented and more focused on participation in the decision-making process, including activities such as voting, participating in political campaigns or causes and running for public office. |

**Description**

###### Preparation

**For Part A:** Divide the participants into smaller teams (4-5 people per group). Note that there should not be more groups than cases in the Handout “Historical Examples of Citizen Journalism”. Give each group paper and pens, as well as the first Handout (Historical Examples of Citizen Journalism).

**For Part B:** Divide the given space with sticky tape on the floor into two parts and label them: the “Agree” part / “Disagree” part. Prepare a set of controversial statements concerning the case studies you explored, as well as the advantages-disadvantages and impact of citizen journalism.

###### Introduction (20-25 minutes)

Begin with a short presentation introducing the concept of citizen journalism and its history in brief (10-15 minutes). You can use the contents of the first Module of the `JOUR-YOU` Online Course (Glossary, Infographics & Video) as the basis for your presentation.

After showing the Video, invite participants to do a short brainstorming, during which they have to name and briefly elaborate on the main characteristics of Citizen Journalism. Give your feedback and ensure all main features are mentioned and understood by the participants.

> **[!NOTE] Information for the facilitator**
> *(See the section "Characteristics of Citizen Journalism" in Tool 2 for details)*

###### Part A – Exploring Historical Examples (60-70 minutes)

All groups have a Handout with one historical case of citizen journalism. They have some time to read the Handout – 5 minutes.

Then the members of each group have 15 minutes to discuss the examples and reflect on them based on the following questions:

*   *How would our knowledge, understanding and feeling about the momentous events described in the Handouts be if there were no citizen journalists around to capture them?*
*   *Which of the characteristics of citizen journalism give it its great power, as outlined in the case you are analysing?*
*   *What are some inherent problems with using social networking sites for publishing information (on which citizen journalism is almost entirely based)? For this aspect, please read the original source provided for the case you are analysing.*
*   *In what ways did citizen journalism contribute to promoting transparency, accountability, and citizen participation in a democratic society in the specific case you are analysing?*

The groups have to take notes and prepare a 6-minute oral presentation of their case – 15 minutes. At the end of this part group presents their case, findings and conclusions to the larger group (2 minutes to present the case and 4 to analyse their answers to the questions).

###### Part B – Historical Debate (45-60 minutes)

Explain the rules of the debate to the participants:

1.  A “controversial statement” is read by the facilitator, and after a short reflection time, participants have to move to the side that corresponds with their opinion about the statement (“Agree” / “Disagree”)
2.  The facilitator encourages multiple participants from each side to explain their position and support it with arguments. The turn is given to one side and then to the other in alternation. Only one person can speak at a time.
3.  During the discussion about one particular statement, it is possible to change sides if someone is convinced by the argumentation of people from the other side. In the best walking debates, many movements can be seen. Participants’ minds are changed by powerful arguments made by others.

<details>
<summary>Information for the facilitator: Indicative controversial statements about Citizen Journalism</summary>

*   *Citizen journalism is the future of news reporting*
*   *Citizen journalism is a way for individuals to gain power and influence without being held accountable for their reporting*
*   *Citizen journalism is often driven by personal or ideological agendas rather than a commitment to the truth*
*   *Citizen journalism can lead to a more informed and engaged citizenry more efficiently than traditional media*
*   *Citizen journalism is a tool to fight misinformation and counteract fake news since it is the only way to circumvent censorship and repression in authoritarian regimes*
*   *Citizen journalism contributes to fake news and disinformation, as opinions and facts can be mixed and published without any control*
*   *Citizen journalism can develop into a form of vigilantism and lead to mob justice*
*   *Citizen journalists are more biased and less reliable than professional journalists*
*   *Nowadays, anyone with access to the necessary digital tools can become a citizen journalist*
*   *Citizen journalism will inevitably replace traditional journalism for the most part*
*   *With the power of new media, citizen journalism has become the most efficient tool for citizen empowerment and democratic control*
*   *The world would be different without citizen journalism*

</details>

Continue with the debate, for 6-10 rounds, depending on the available time and after sensing the energy in the group.

**Debriefing questions**

*   What did you learn about the history and definition of citizen journalism?
*   How did citizen journalism change the conversation about the particular monumental events examined? What were the consequences thereof?
*   What are the lessons learned from the historical examples explored, and how can these be applied to the practice of citizen journalism today?
*   What role do you think citizen journalism can play in your community?

###### Arab Spring – 2010

The Arab Spring was a revolutionary rise of both peaceful and violent demonstrations, coups, riots, and protests starting in North Africa and spreading across the Middle East, that began in December 2010 in Tunisia. By 2012, the initial wave of revolutions in these countries dwindled due to brutal responses from government authorities and counter-demonstrators, and grave conflicts followed, such as the Syrian Civil War, the Libyan Civil War, and the Yemeni crisis.

The Arab Spring protests were documented on social media, including large amounts of content produced by citizen journalists who relayed compelling scenes of repression and revolution in those countries across the world. Networks formed online were crucial in organising a core group of activists, especially in Egypt. Additionally, digital media has been used by Arabs to exercise freedom of speech and as a space for civic engagement.

*The Role of Social Media in the Arab Uprisings*

The wealth of content produced by citizens during the Arab uprisings was such that Peter Snowdon, film director and journalist, created ["The Uprising"](https://theuprising.be/Trailer), a film composed entirely of cell phone shot videos made by both citizens and residents of Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Libya, and Yemen, providing a unique, and truly raw perspective of the Arab Spring Revolutions from the inside, uncorrupted by different media outlets.

###### Mumbai Attacks – 2008

In November 2008, a series of 12 coordinated shooting and bombing attacks by Lashkar-e-Taiba, a terrorist organisation from Pakistan, shook Mumbai for four days.

The data uploaded by individuals about the Mumbai attacks played a vital role in propagating information. They marked a new epoch of citizen journalism because of its capacity to provide real-time reports of the developments on the ground. The few professional journalists presented on-site could hardly compete with the masses of people around the city using social networking sites who were updating `Twitter` and `Flickr` through their mobile phones whenever new developments emerged.

As the first attacks took place in Mumbai, the first reports about the events ostensibly appeared on `Twitter` even before mainstream media agencies could release news stories. By tagging posts related to the attacks with the hashtag `#mumbai`, users provided first-hand accounts by providing the social networking service with a constant stream of reports and comments. At the same time, people were loading images onto `Flickr`, a photo-sharing website. Even mainstream media outlets were utilising some images from the site for their reports. Photographer Vinukumar Ranganathan became an overnight sensation when his `Flickr` page attracted hundreds of thousands of hits for the pictures he uploaded of the immediate aftermath of the attacks.

Bloggers were also participating actively in disseminating information. Blogs like “Mumbai Help” aggregated the information derived from `Twitter` and `Flickr`, and also listed the contact details of embassy and consulate hotlines created for the crisis. It also sought to help individuals contact their friends and family in Mumbai. The blog provided a way for volunteers and interested parties to connect and was a site where the deluge of information could be consolidated, easily accessed and made comprehensible.

###### The Fall of the Twin Towers – 2001

The skyline of New York City was forever changed on the morning of September 11, 2001, as two planes crashed into the World Trade Centre’s Twin Towers in a brazen terrorist attack. The first plane struck the North Tower at approximately 8:45 a.m., causing a massive explosion and debris showering onto the streets below. Just minutes later, a second plane crashed into the South Tower, engulfing the building in flames.

Eyewitnesses reported scenes of chaos and horror as panicked workers and visitors present in the Towers attempted to flee the scene. Emergency responders raced to the site to assist while both the NYPD and the FDNY were on high alert. With a death toll of almost 3,000 people, this was the deadliest terrorist attack in world history and had a profound impact on the United States and the world.

The Fall of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre is considered by many to be the rise of citizen journalism. Many large news websites desperately sought authentic material from people connected to the tragedy, showcasing that ordinary people could capture and report on stories in a way that journalists couldn’t.

The president of the New York Historical Society, Kenneth T. Jackson stated that “as many as 100 cameras captured United Airlines Flight 175 flying into the south tower, thousands of cameras caught the towers falling, and hundreds of thousands recorded the aftermath on that day”. Jackson stated, “It is the most documented event in human history”.

###### Boxing day Tsunami earthquake – 2004

On December 26th 2004, a 9.2 magnitude earthquake occurred under the Indian Ocean off the Western Coast of Northern Sumatra in Indonesia, making it the fourth largest earthquake in modern times. The result was a massive tsunami, with waves up to 30 meters (!), that affected 14 countries. The tsunami wiped away homes, schools and health facilities; it demolished roads, bridges and power lines; it irrevocably altered the lives of millions of people and cost the life of an estimated 230,000 people, more than one-third of which were missing children.

The disaster was a turning point for citizen journalism, with many of the first images and reports coming from ordinary people on the scene. In fact, for the first 24 hours, all reported coverage was images and videos sent in from people first-hand.

Bloggers created interactive resources to aid in humanitarian efforts and share vital information, and the number of blogs grew rapidly in the hours and days following the disaster.

The Tsunami is considered a pivotal point in the timeline of citizen journalism because it was one of the first events where traditional media recognised ordinary people as contributing to useful journalism. It was an example of citizens keeping one another informed during a time of great need, bringing people together as a community.

###### Parkland High-School Shootings – 2018

On February 14, 2018, a former student opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people and injuring 17 others. The shooter was armed with a semi-automatic rifle and used smoke grenades to create chaos as he moved through the school. The shooting lasted six minutes before the shooter dropped his weapon and fled.

The incident prompted widespread discussions about gun control and school safety measures, resulting in a national movement for gun law reform led by the student survivors of the shooting.

Scenes from the shooting were viewed by millions of people almost live, with gunshots and screams recorded by students hiding in classrooms, for everyone on the internet to see and hear.

This event was another example of how smartphones, social media and citizen journalists have changed how people learn about and understand major events almost as they are happening. For a country, in which school shootings have become a regular occurrence, the material produced by witnessing citizen journalists provides a vantage point that isn’t otherwise available, much more visceral and emotionally impactful than the one TV reporters can offer.

###### GEZI PARKI PROTESTS – 2013

A wave of demonstrations and civil unrest in Turkey began on 28 May 2013, initially to contest the urban development plan for Taksim Gezi Park, Istanbul. The protests were sparked by outrage at the violent eviction of a sit-in at the park from a small group of citizens protesting the plan. Subsequently, supporting protests and strikes took place across Turkey against a wide range of concerns, at the core of which were issues of freedom of the press, expression and assembly, as well as the erosion of Turkish secularism by the Islamist political government.

What is so significant about this movement, in particular, it was made possible solely through the organic adoption of networked journalism, defined by Jeff Jarvis as “professionals and amateurs working together to get the real story, \[sharing] facts, questions, answers, ideas, perspectives, \[recognising] the complex relationships that will make news, and \[focusing] on the process more than the product”.

Between 29 May to 10 June 2013, the use of `Twitter` per day in Turkey increased from 1.8 to 10 million. There were more than 20 hashtags related to the protests that became the most popular worldwide trend topics. Six of these hashtags went over the 1 million messages per day barrier, showing the world what was happening: The government’s violent response to the riots, which included water cannon vehicles and tear gas grenades, combined with social media blackouts, the clampdown on nonconformist media channels, the self-censorship of the independent mass media, the disinformation campaign of the pro-government media, and the unprecedented violence of the Turkish police forces towards unarmed protesters were captured time and time again in photos and used against them.

The root cause of the movement seemed to be straightforward at first (protesting the destruction of a beloved national park and public space), but environmental zeal did not explain why the movement was so successful and reached far beyond its intra-national focus. The reason was much more unique and reflexive: 84% of demonstrators in Istanbul cited lack of media coverage as a reason for joining the protests, compared with 56% who cited the destruction of the park. Vatikiotis and Yoruk describe the protests as “the moment of the eruption of a series of accumulated social discontents”. In a way, Gezi was an ideological battle between networked citizen journalism and mainstream traditional journalism.

**Description**

###### Introduction

The facilitator divides the participants into small groups of 4-5 individuals, consisting of people from different countries.

###### Main Activity

The trainer randomly gives each group a ***historical example of citizen journalism*** and asks them to create a mural or painting that visually represents the story and its impact on society (**20 minutes**).

The groups can also be asked to include quotes or key information about the example in their mural (**5 minutes**).

The mural will be created on large pieces of paper and displayed in a central location for all participants.

Each group presents their historical depiction (***5 minutes***), followed by a group discussion over the results (***10 minutes***).

Finally, all the participants will form a big circle (*remaining close to their groups*) and formulate the exact historical order of the events depicted.

**Debriefing questions**

*   Did you find any improvements between the historical examples and nowadays citizen journalism?
*   What is the role of citizen journalism in your community?

**Description**

Cut out the Flashcards with cases where citizen journalism exposed propaganda of the traditional media, and stick them to the wall in a “gallery formation” (i.e., stretching a whole wall, arranging in a row or a grid pattern to make it easier for many people to see different items at the same time and quickly skim through them).

The facilitator divides the participants into groups of 3-4 people and then introduces the activity by explaining to the groups that this is a simulation of media representation, which goal is creating a video.

The groups have **5 minutes** to skim through the gallery of cases and select one case for their video.

After each group has chosen their preferred case (multiple groups can work on the same case), participants have **15 minutes** to search more about it; how it was covered by traditional media and how by citizen journalists.

Then each group has **45 minutes** to record a short video (of ***3 minutes duration***) highlighting how citizen journalism can play a crucial role in uncovering the truth and exposing propaganda but also how it can sometimes facilitate the spread of false or misleading information. The information that should be included in each video is the particular event (the “case”); how it was covered in traditional media; how it was covered by citizen journalists. The way this information will be presented (e.g., *in a serious journalistic tone; as satire; as a talk show; as a theatrical play; action movie, etc.*) is up to the participants.

At the end of this activity, each group presents its video to the rest of the teams. At the end of all presentations, participants discuss the differences between traditional and citizen journalism, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each (Debriefing).

*\*Another option than video making includes: Storytelling practice*

**Debriefing questions**

*   What did you learn about the particular case you chose to work on? Did anything surprise you about the different ways traditional media and citizen journalists covered it?
*   How did your group choose to present the information in your video? Why did you choose this approach?
*   How can citizen journalism help counteract propaganda? Does it always provide a more accurate and unbiased perspective on events and issues?
*   What did you learn about the advantages and disadvantages of citizen journalism compared to traditional media?

## Citizen Journalism as a Tool for Community Engagement

This topic focuses primarily on understanding Citizen Journalism as a means of engaging local audiences. The training tools included in it have the task of forming knowledge and skills for engaging the attention of the audience by identifying information needs and discovering appropriate sources of information. Special attention is paid to the need to understand which sources of information people trust and how to use this knowledge.

The topic also includes the basic concepts of storytelling. These are elements related to the application of basic principles in creating content to engage the audience.

**Description**

###### Part A – Identifying Community Needs and Solutions

Divide the participants into small groups of 3-4 people. If they come from different countries, create same-country groups. Each group gets a flipchart paper, some post-its and markers. Ask the groups to read the Handout (Sources of Information on Community Issues) and research relevant sources to gain an overview of important issues faced by their communities (at the city or country level) – 10 minutes.

After the research, each group has to brainstorm and list the needs and issues within their community on the flipchart papers using post-it notes. These can include issues related to housing, education, healthcare, transportation, safety, environmental problems, resources and services for families, etc. – 10 minutes.

Once the groups have finished listing the main needs and issues, ask them to organise the post-it notes into categories – 3 minutes.

After that, ask the groups to think of potential solutions for each need/issue included in their list. Each “problem/issue post-it” has to be matched with a “solution post-it” – 10 minutes.

Once the groups have finished, ask each group to present their needs, issues, and solutions to the whole group – 5 minutes per group.

###### Part B – Examining Community Issues through a different lens

Ask the teams to select one minority group prevalent in their community (e.g., low-income families, migrants, people with disabilities, senior citizens, etc.) and go through their listed problems, thinking about how their selected minority group are experiencing them. Finally, they have to choose one problem they consider the gravest one for that group – 10 minutes.

**Debriefing questions**

*   What did you learn about the needs and issues in your community?
*   How did your group approach the task of identifying the main issues faced by your community?
*   How did you identify the solutions to those problems?
*   What were some challenges you faced while working in your group?
*   What did you learn about the experiences of the minority group you selected? Were there any surprises or new insights that came to light as you considered the problem from the perspective of this group?

###### Municipality websites

Many municipalities have official websites on which they publish information about their services, plans, and programs, as well as, reports on various issues. Skimming through such websites can give a broad overview of some significant community issues!

###### Social media community groups

Social media pages or groups created by citizens themselves and dedicated to specific neighbourhoods or communities can be a great source of relevant information.

###### Hashtags

`Twitter` hashtags such as `#communityissues`, `#localnews`, `#communityengagement`, etc., can help find information about the issues faced by the community. Also, trending hashtags in your area can navigate one quickly among the major up-to-date concerns of one’s country/community.

###### News websites

Local e-newspapers are also a rich source of information about the issues faced by a specific community, as well as, about the initiatives being taken to address them.

###### Data Portals

Some data portals provide open access to a wide range of data and statistics, including information on community issues, at different levels (local, national and international). At the EU level, for example, some of the most notable data portals include `Eurostat`, `Open Data Portal`, `European Data Portal`, `European Environment Agency`, `European Health Data and Evidence Network`, etc.

###### Non-governmental or community organisation

Another useful source of information regarding community issues is the local ecosystem of civil society organisations. These organisations are often active in addressing specific issues in the community, such as poverty, education, health, the environment, and human rights. Searching their websites can help citizens gain an overview of the issues communities face and the approaches taken to address those issues.

**Description**

The facilitator divides the participants into groups of 3-4 people, and they sit down in circles. Then, the trainer introduces the activity by explaining to all of the groups that this activity is based on group discussion. Therefore, the participants should suggest ideas about how a young person can help enhance community engagement through citizen journalism activities.

Each group has ***25*** minutes to discuss and write down their ideas on pieces of paper. Then, each group member has 5 minutes to present an idea and stick it around the centre of the flipchart, giving the floor to the next ones. The trainer asks for comments and feedback regarding the ideas presented.

**Debriefing questions**

*   What are your thoughts on the ideas that you just presented?
*   Which ideas are the three most promising? And why?
*   Did you have difficulties finding innovative ideas that could enhance community engagement through citizen journalism?

**Description**

Divide the participants into smaller teams (3-4 people per group). Give each group a set of post-its and markers as well as the first Handout (Sources of Information on Community Issues)

###### Part A – Identifying issues of marginalised groups (25 minutes)

Assign each team a different group of people with fewer opportunities within the local area (e.g., low-income tenants, senior citizens, immigrant communities, etc.) through random selection (for instance, paper strips with the different social groups in a cup, out of which each team has to draw one strip).

Each team should research and gather information about their assigned social group and identify a list of issues they face in their community. To facilitate the research process, the teams can use the “Sources of Information on Community Issues: Handout”, which can help them navigate more easily through relevant sources.

Then, each team has to select one problem; the one they think has the most negative effects on their social group.

###### Part B – Feature Article

Begin with a short presentation about feature articles and tips on how to write a good one – 10-15 minutes.

Share the Handout “Writing a Feature Article” to all groups. Each team has to create a Feature article (800-1000 words long) presenting a “Human Interest Story” or a “Profile feature article” regarding a person from their selected social group that a. highlights the community issue from the perspective of that group; b. provides some ideas on possible solutions c. includes a call to action (i.e., telling the audience to do something, either explicitly or implicitly) – 30-40 minutes

Allow time for each group to present their articles to the rest of the participants – 3 minutes per group.

After the presentation of each article, ask the rest of the participants to provide their feedback and recommendations for improvement for each part of the article (Topic, Headline, Introduction, Body, Conclusion) – 5 minutes per group.

***Alternative Version***

If you implement the activity “Community Needs Solutions”, you can skip part A of this activity.

**Debriefing questions**

These questions can help participants provide useful feedback in a structured manner:

*   **Topic:**
    *   Is the topic relevant to the selected social group and the issue highlighted?
    *   Does it effectively address the issue from the perspective of the group?
*   **Headline:**
    *   Does the headline effectively communicate the essence of the story?
    *   Is it catchy and attention-grabbing?
*   **Introduction:**
    *   Does the introduction provide sufficient background information on the selected social group and the issue highlighted?
    *   Does it effectively engage the reader and set the tone for the rest of the article?
*   **Body:**
    *   Does the main part of the article provide sufficient detail and information to support the story being told (e.g., does it “show” or “tell”, are the opinions expressed adequately corroborated?
    *   Are the sources of information credible and reliable?
    *   Does the article make use of effective rhetorical and literary techniques?
*   **Conclusion:**
    *   Does the conclusion effectively summarise the main points of the article?
    *   Does it include a clear call to action that is relevant to the audience?

<summary>Presentation: Feature Article Basics</summary>

**What is a feature article?**

A feature article is a **persuasive text** *that expresses an **opinion***, informs the reader about a subject and is enjoyable to read. Feature articles are usually **longer** and **more descriptive** than other types of news articles and often aim to **capture** the readers' **attention** and **engage** them on a personal level.

A feature article is a **soft news story** that can be delivered in many ways. It can be a personal profile, a human-interest story or a more in-depth look at an issue. Many people enjoy writing in this format because it is *freer flowing* and less *restrictive* than a straight news article.

**Differences from a news article**

*   **Purpose:** Feature articles are written to **entertain, inform** or **educate** the reader, while news articles aim to report on events and current issues
*   **Tone:** Feature articles are often written in a more **conversational and personal tone**, while news articles are more objective and straightforward.
*   **Length:** Feature articles tend to be **longer** and **more in-depth**, while news articles are usually shorter and focus on the most important facts.
*   **Structure:** Feature articles often have a more **creative** structure and may use elements such as ***anecdotes, quotes***, and ***vivid descriptions*** to engage the reader. News articles possess a more straightforward structure and stick to the Five Ws (who, what, when, where, why).
*   **Topic:** Feature articles can cover a ***wider range of topics*** and be more focused on ***human-interest stories, profiles*** and ***lifestyle issues.***
*   **Style:** Feature articles often have a more ***literary style*** and may use ***figurative language***, while news articles tend to be more straightforward and avoid flowery language.

###### Features are not meant to deliver the news, but they contain some news elements.

**Main purpose:** to add the human element to the news, to add colour and feeling. They often recap major news already reported.

Example: The hard news story would be the opening of the new school. The soft news is the profile, which brings readers more information about the person who is running the school. These types of stories provide readers with insight into the news.

**Types of feature articles**

*   **Profile**: A profile feature article focuses on a person, organisation, or place, providing in-depth information about their background, history, and current activities
*   **Human-interest stories**: Similar to personality profiles, however, they do not always have a strong news peg. These are stories reported because they are unusual or have emotional or entertainment value.
*   **Personal Essay**: A personal essay is a reflective piece that often explores the author's own experiences and thoughts on a particular topic.
*   **Trend Piece**: A trend piece highlights a current trend, event, or phenomenon and provides an in-depth look at why it is happening and its significance.
*   **How-To**: A how-to feature article provides step-by-step instructions or advice on a particular topic, such as cooking, gardening, or repairing a car.

**Language of feature articles**

*   Develop a personal tone - Share your opinions.
*   Show your personality (e.g., humorous, serious, etc.) - Use semi-formal language (i.e., some colloquialism) - Use emotive language.
*   Refer to the audience in the second person language (e.g., “you”).
*   Use literary and rhetorical techniques to engage the reader (e.g., rhetorical questions, anecdotes, imagery, etc.)
*   Do not overuse adjectives or adverbs. Use strong verbs and nouns to describe instead of adjectives and adverbs.
*   Use facts, quotes and jargon to add authenticity - Make sure you write in the active voice.

**Structure of feature articles**

1.  **Research / Planning**: Conduct thorough research on the subject, including interviews with key people, a review of relevant literature, desk research of online sources and/ or field visits to relevant locations.
2.  **Header / Title**: Feature articles are known for their eye-catching headers!
3.  **Introduction**: Write a strong lead that immediately captures the readers' attention and provides a hook for the rest of the article.
4.  **Body**: This is where the story unfolds, and you share your key messages/ opinions.
5.  **Conclusion**: Conclusions are especially important in feature articles because they summarise your ideas and stance and ultimately inspire your readers to act.

| **Duration**                     | 90-120 minutes                                          |
| **Number of participants**       | 12-32 people, age 15+                                   |

**Description**

###### Introduction

The facilitator starts presenting the definition of cognitive biases and their different types (***5 minutes***).

###### Part A

The participants are split into pairs or groups of 3-4 people. The trainer delivers a beanie/paper cup that goes round and round in the circle, including ***definitions of media manipulation techniques***.

When the music stops, the person holding the beanie/paper cup pulls out a piece of paper and reads a definition. Then, the facilitator asks which cognitive biases the specific manipulation technique 'takes advantage of', until all definitions are read.

Afterwards, the trainer gives snippets of the Cognitive Biases Handout to each group, and the participants have ***6 minutes*** to match the definitions with the correct example. The groups discuss their results and are given feedback by the facilitator.

###### Part B

The participants should follow the same procedure for the second part of the activity. Inside a beanie/paper cup, put cut-out papers with the name of ***each bias*** presented in the Handout.

Participants form a big circle, and music starts to play. As long as the music plays, participants should give the beanie to the person sitting next to them. Every time the music stops, the person holding the beanie has to select one of the papers. Then the whole group of that person steps out of the circle. The process repeats until all groups have a paper in their hand: their “***assigned cognitive bias***”.

Participants have ***5 minutes*** to discuss among each other examples of biased perceptions they have encountered, corresponding to their “assigned bias”.

Each group has ***25 minutes*** to select one of those examples and draw a “comic” on their flipchart that clearly illustrates their assigned cognitive bias. If participants cannot think of real-life examples, they can think of an imaginary example. Once they are ready, they hang their “Art Exhibit” on the wall.

When all groups have completed their comics, they are given ***5 minutes*** to check all Art Exhibits and try to recognise the type of bias illustrated. After that, people return to their positions (each group in front of their Art Exhibit), and the facilitator asks the rest about their opinions.

**Debriefing questions**

*   Was it easy to think of a scenario for your assigned type of bias? Could you think of examples that happened in your real life?
*   What evidence can prove that your belief is right or wrong? Is it easier to find and accept evidence that supports your views vs those that disprove them?
*   Which kind of cognitive bias have you encountered a lot so far? In your opinion, could it be used in citizen journalism and which type?

<summary>Handout: Media Manipulation Techniques</summary>

*(Note: Activity involves matching/discussion)*

###### Astroturfing

Astroturfing is the attempt to create an impression of widespread grassroots support for a policy, individual, or product, where little such support exists. This has also occurred in newspapers during political election seasons. Businesses and political parties attempt to pass themselves off as grassroots groups to persuade the public to believe untrue information.

###### Clickbait

Clickbait typically refers to the practice of writing sensationalised or misleading headlines to attract clicks on a piece of content. It often relies on exaggerating claims or leaving out key information to encourage traffic.

###### Propaganda

Propaganda is communication that is primarily used to influence or persuade an audience to further an agenda, which may not be objective and may be selectively presenting facts to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is being presented.

###### Audio manipulation / Photo manipulation / Video manipulation

*(Implied category for techniques altering media)*

###### Distraction by major events

This tactic, also referred to as “smoke screen”, involves getting the audience to concentrate on a subject that the propagandist finds more expedient. In popular culture, this specific form of media manipulation has been frequently mentioned.

###### Framing

The idea of framing is similar to the practice of defining an agenda, but it broadens the scope of the research by concentrating on the core of the current problems rather than on a single subject. The foundation of framing theory is that certain occurrences are brought to light by the media, which then contextualises them.

###### Logical fallacy

It is an example of thinking delivered invalid by an imperfection in sensible construction that can flawlessly be communicated in a standard rationale framework, for instance, propositional logic. A formal fallacy occurs when the deduction is no longer a logical process and the argument itself has true premises but a false conclusion.

###### Dumbing Down

Dumbing down is the deliberate oversimplification of complex issues (e.g., thought-terminating cliches). The general idea behind this concept lies in seeking to engage an audience that is willing to compromise any pretence of accuracy.

###### Biased Reporting

Biased reporting occurs when the direction or statistical significance of results influences whether and how research is reported. It is mainly about reporting information coloured by ideology.

###### False Dichotomy

The incorrect assertion that there are only two choices in a particular situation (e.g., us versus them).

###### Suppression of Information

The situation in which important and relevant facts and conclusions that are in the public interest to be disclosed are concealed or withheld from the public domain. In other words, holding back information, because it does not benefit the agenda.

###### Fallacies

A fallacy is the use of invalid or otherwise faulty reasoning in the construction of an argument, which may appear to be a well-reasoned argument if unnoticed. Fallacies may be committed intentionally to manipulate or persuade by deception, unintentionally because of human limitations such as carelessness, cognitive or social biases and ignorance or potentially due to the limitations of language and understanding of language.

###### Sock-puppeting

Spreading disinformation from a large number of aliases (e.g., a government that controls millions of social media accounts).

###### Anonymous authorities

The unspecified source is used as evidence for the claim or even generalised groups, such as “scientists say” or “experts agree”.

| Bias Type                       | Definition                                                                                                                            | Example                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Confirmation Bias**           | The tendency to search for, interpret, favour, and recall information in a way that confirms or supports one's preexisting beliefs.      | A person believing a certain political party is corrupt will primarily seek out and remember news stories highlighting that party's scandals, ignoring positive news. |
| **Anchoring Bias**              | Relying too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor") when making decisions.                                   | Seeing a T-shirt initially priced at \$100, then marked down to \$50, makes \$50 seem like a great deal, even if the shirt's actual value is much lower.           |
| **Availability Heuristic**      | Overestimating the importance or likelihood of events that are more easily recalled in memory, often because they are recent or vivid. | Fearing a plane crash more than a car crash after seeing news reports about a recent air disaster, despite car travel being statistically more dangerous.       |
| **Bandwagon Effect**            | The tendency for individuals to adopt certain behaviours or beliefs because many others are doing so.                               | Buying a particular brand of smartphone because it's the most popular one among peers, regardless of personal needs or preferences.                             |
| **Dunning-Kruger Effect**       | A cognitive bias whereby people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability.                                                | Someone who has just started learning chess believes they are already a very skilled player and likely to beat experienced opponents.                            |
| **Fundamental Attribution Error** | The tendency to over-emphasise personality-based explanations for behaviours observed in others while under-emphasising situational explanations. | Seeing someone trip and assuming they are clumsy, rather than considering that the pavement might be uneven.                                                    |
| **Self-Serving Bias**           | The tendency to attribute successes to internal factors (skill, talent) and failures to external factors (bad luck, unfairness).       | A student gets an A on a test and attributes it to being smart; gets an F on another test and blames the teacher for making it too hard.                     |
| **Hindsight Bias**              | The tendency to see past events as being more predictable than they actually were; the "I knew it all along" effect.                   | After a stock market crash, claiming it was obvious that it was going to happen, even though there was significant uncertainty beforehand.                        |
| **Framing Effect**              | Drawing different conclusions from the same information, depending on how that information is presented (framed).                      | A medical treatment described as having a "90% survival rate" sounds more appealing than one described as having a "10% mortality rate," even though they are the same. |
| **Negativity Bias**             | The tendency to give more weight to negative experiences or information than positive ones.                                            | Remembering one critical comment about a presentation more vividly than several positive comments received.                                                      |
| **Actor-Observer Bias**         | Tendency to attribute one's own actions to external causes while attributing other people's behaviors to internal causes.             | You fail an exam and blame the tricky questions (external), but when a classmate fails, you think they didn't study enough (internal).                        |

| **Optimism Bias**               | Tendency for an individual to believe that they are less likely to experience a negative event compared to others.                  | Believing you are less likely to get into a car accident while texting and driving compared to other drivers.                                                   |

**Description**

In this group activity, participants are divided into equal groups of 3-4 participants and asked to think of a pressing problem concerning their imagined small community. Each group of participants represents a small community of people. Then, they formed small groups to brainstorm and discuss their problems (20 minutes).

In the second part of the activity, each group nominates one person to be an investigative citizen journalist and to go to one of the other groups to find out more about the problems and needs of the given group/community (15 minutes).

In the third part of the activity, the investigative citizen journalists return to their initial groups and prepare an article on a flipchart paper to present the other group's concerns/problems. In other words, each group will prepare an article for one of the other groups (15 minutes).

Each small group will create a presentation about one of the other communities involved in the activity and present it on a flipchart paper as news or publications about the given problem that the community is facing.

**Debriefing questions**

*   Was it hard to identify one problem concerning your small community?
*   Did you feel pressed as a group to find negative connotations concerning someone else’s community?
*   Was it difficult to be objective when your small group presented others small community problems?
*   Did you feel like you wanted to work on a different issue concerning your own community?

## Leadership or How to Build Audience Development

Not everyone can be a leader, but developing leadership qualities is a key factor for the successful realisation of a citizen journalist. Included in this theme are training tools that help young people identify the essential qualities of a leader and receive guidance on how to develop them within themselves.

Main attention is paid to the development of skills to participate in debate, to discover and communicate arguments and to defend one's own position. The use of rhetorical principles as part of storytelling is also advocated. In this part, the focus is on developing basic communication skills and using them to build community around specific social and ethical issues.

**Description**

The participants are divided into groups of 3-4 people. One is the content creator who has to create a video that the government ordered to allow them better understand a social problem from the citizens’ perspective. The other participants in the group are citizens. First, participants should agree on a social problem on which they want to communicate and raise awareness (5 minutes). Then, they should search for factual information that characterises the problem to make it as concrete as possible (statistics, data, numbers, etc.) (10 minutes).

Each citizen must represent an actor affected particularly by the social problem. They will be interviewed later, and their statement will be included in the short video presentation. Citizens must, therefore, find the speech they will give for the video (10 minutes).

Finally, they need to think as a group about possible solutions implying the government’s measures that can improve or resolve the problem and address directly to the government to push them to take concrete actions (5 minutes).

When all this information has been gathered, the group should realise the video respecting these parts (introduction of the social problem, interviews of at least two people affected by the problem, solutions, and call to action). The video must not be longer than 3 minutes. (5 minutes). Each group will present their video to the others at the end.

**Debriefing questions**

*   Did you find it hard to communicate a social problem through a video?
*   Why do you think this is relevant to include interviews in such content?
*   Do you think this type of online content can make a difference and leads to concrete decisions from the government’s side?

**Description**

Divide the participants into two groups of 3-6 people and one group of 2. The two groups of 3-6 people represent the citizens. The two other people will be the representatives of the government.

Each group needs to prepare **an oral speech** which will be structured and aimed at **convincing the government to build a road allowing access to a distant village**. They are free to imagine the names of the places and their characteristics.

They shall refer to political, social and economic reasons to be as convincing as possible.

The groups will have **10 minutes** to prepare the speech and **5 minutes** to present it. They need to designate someone to be the **spokesperson**. Both groups will be assessed according to the **scorecard** (see handout).

After both groups presented their oral speech, the government filled out the scorecard for each of them and **elected** the most convincing group.

The winning group can **choose two people to become leaders of the government** while the initial governors become citizens in the winning group.

**Another round** is played.

**Debriefing questions**

*   Was it challenging to build your arguments based on political, social and economic reasons?
*   What is difficult for the people representing the government to judge the reasoning of the groups?
*   What are important points when building our argumentation?

**Description**

Participants are divided into two groups. Each group chooses a leader.

The moderator sets a question for debate that concerns a moral, ethical, civil or social issue and that can be related to any of the cases of the online course. The moderator tosses the coin and determines which team will be the first to choose the position to argue on the question. The other team defends an opposite position.

The moderator gives one ball to each team leader. The two teams line up in a semi-circle opposite each other. Leaders stand facing their team and are back-to-back.

Each team has 2 minutes to give as many arguments supporting their position. The leader must throw the ball to the different players to allow them to present their arguments alternatively. After stating an argument, the participant returns the ball to his leader, who throws it to another participant.

After the first team's time is up, the moderator awards one point for each **topic-related** and **relevant argument** made by the players. Repeated, similar, or unrelated arguments do not count.

The moderator repeats the same procedure with the second team.

***Second round***

In the **second round**, each team has 4 minutes. Here, their task is to choose one counter-argument for each argument of the other team. The participant who spoke last in the first round becomes the leader. After the time expired, the moderator awards points according to the already used rules and repeats the same procedure with the second team.

***Third round (no timer used)***

The **third and final round is held** under the same rules. The participant who first participated during the second round becomes the leader. If he has already been a leader, his place is taken by the second ball receiver in the team. The participants must use the arguments from the first round and the counter-arguments from the second one to formulate their team's position on the question. Each of the participants argues his position.

When both teams finish, a secret vote is held within each team to determine the player who best argues for the position. The selected player presents the indicated position to the other team. He should expand on his position by including arguments stated by his teammates.

The moderator determines which player argues better for his position and gives 5 points to the best team. The other team receives from 1 to 3 points depending on the strength of the arguments presented. The winner is the team that has collected more points.

**Debriefing questions**

*   How to select arguments to defend our position?
*   How to arrange our arguments - starting from the most important or the least important?
*   How can we relate our arguments to the moral, ethical, social or civic side of the debated issue?
*   What is the role of counterarguments?
*   What is the role of the synthesis in arguing the position we take?

## Fake News and Disinformation – Strategies for Identification

Fake news is a major tool of disinformation. They are something that young people face all the time in their lives. Recognising them and discovering their sources is of particular importance so that they can counter the continuous attempts to be manipulated. Moreover, as future citizen journalists, the ability to recognise fake news is a key prerequisite for building audience trust. On the other hand, the ability to recognise fake news is a tool for reducing its spread and impact.

The main task of training in this topic is to create skills for detecting fake news and discovering their sources. Various tools are proposed that can support the development of knowledge and skills in this direction.

### 16. Real vs. Fake

| **Skills and concepts targeted** | Critical and analytical thinking <br> Fact-checking <br> Developing media literacy skills |
| :------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Objectives**                   | To widen awareness of the impact of fake news on society <br> To develop critical and analytical thinking skills <br> To cultivate a sense of responsibility and a commitment to the flow of transparent information                                                                                                       |
| **Materials needed**             | Flipchart papers, A4 papers, pens and markers                                            |
| **Tools, sources**               | Three real news articles <br> Three fake news articles                                      |
| **Duration**                     | 40 minutes                                                                               |

**Description**

In this activity, participants are divided into equal groups and given three real and three fake news articles.

Then, participants should read the news, think for 20 minutes and come up with an answer and count on how many real and fake news articles there are.

After the groups have decided on real and fake news articles, a discussion follows with all the groups.

The facilitator writes on a flipchart paper each group’s reasoning behind their choices.

**Debriefing questions**

*   Was it hard to believe what you are reading is real or, on the contrary, fake?
*   Did you have fierce discussions with your group members concerning the credibility of each news article you read?
*   Did you use any mechanisms to evaluate the credibility and truthfulness of the articles you read?
*   Did you apply any of the learned in practice?

**Description**

Divide the participants into groups of 3-4 people.

Each group searches the internet for three pieces of news that are as ‘strange’ as possible. Then, they invent a piece of news that seems likely (20 minutes). A suggestion to make fake news hard to recognise can be to take real news and edit it.

The groups present the news in turn. After each presentation, the other groups have 10 minutes to consult internally or search on the internet to understand which of the four pieces of news is false. The groups vote on what they think is false news (15 minutes per group).

At the end of the lap, the group that recognised more fake news wins.

**Debriefing questions**

*   What were the criteria for looking for true information that seemed false?
*   What were the criteria for creating false information that seemed true?
*   How was it possible to recognise fake news?

## Creating Content Online and Reporting Events

Perhaps the most important requirement for being a citizen journalist is the ability to create attractive and credible online content. The role that the internet and social media play in people's lives makes online content a major way to disseminate information. Moreover, all the efforts of businesses and brands to win and keep people's attention online places many demands on the quality of presentation of online content, which citizen journalists must comply with. This means they learn to create content that can compete for their audiences' attention.

The training tools in this topic are specifically aimed at developing the skills to create online content. On the other hand, the focus in these trainings falls on familiarising young people with the basic principles of reporting events and communicating their important elements to the audience.

### 20. How Important Every Detail Is

**Description**

Participants cut small squares with scissors. On each of them, they write one letter of the alphabet. Letters can repeat, but at least one square is required for each letter. The squares are turned face down and shuffled. Participants choose one of them to record the results.

Four of the participants take one square each. From the letters drawn, they try to form a word or the beginning of a word by combining them or changing their places. The chosen participant writes the word on the flipchart paper. The squares are returned to the table, shuffled, and the participants draw another four. The group continues until five different words are obtained.

The moderator chooses a topic on which the participants should make a report. The moderator determines the media channel on which the report will be broadcast. This could be a social media profile, a blog, a news site, a video channel, etc.

Participants are divided into two groups. Each of the groups writes the five words on separate sheets. Out of the five words, they take one. They are tasked with formulating what the four words have in common and how the fifth differs from them. It is recommended to avoid formal similarities and differences (e.g., four are nouns, and the fifth is an adjective). One person from each team writes down the pair of opposite characteristics that are obtained. The removed word is returned, and another of the five words is placed in its place. The procedure continues until all five words have been extracted.

The two teams write the received qualities on a flip chart. Using the markers, they try to find connections between the obtained characteristics and group them into new ones. Rank the resulting new features in order of importance based on the team's chosen logic.

The moderator gives 15 minutes to both teams to write a story on the given topic using the obtained characteristics. They can be referred both to the participants in the story and to other elements of which it is composed - place, action, groups of people, institutions, etc.

Each team read the created story. Participants discuss how each story can be visualised depending on the media channel chosen.

**Debriefing questions**

*   How-to pick-up details that can help us develop the story of the report better?
*   How does the search for connections between the various elements involved in the report help us?
*   How to use creative thinking to make a story more impactful?

**Description**

The participants are divided into four groups: NGO representatives, a private construction company, local authority and citizen journalists. Every group receives handouts about their role in the community.

The moderator presents the general situation: NGO representatives organise a protest against construction within the park in the city where you live. The citizen journalist group wants to report the event in their blog. During the protest, citizen journalists divide and meet representatives of the NGO, local council and the construction company and interview them. Then, the citizen journalists construct their articles.

The groups read their handouts and elaborate on the topic (10 minutes). Then, they go to the protest and answer the questions of the citizen journalists (20 minutes).

Then, citizen journalists prepare a short article with the stakeholders' views (20 minutes) and present it to the other groups.

The moderator asks the citizen journalist group to present the story. Then, ask the other groups whether their positions were reflected rightly in the story, according to the handout of their role and their further elaboration.

**Debriefing questions**

*   Can you formulate the main problem?
*   Which side was missing in this situation?
*   What are the pros and cons of every group represented in the game?

<summary>Handout: State their truth</summary>

###### NGO Representatives

We form the board of our NGO Protect the Parks. We have received complaints from citizens that the city council and a private construction company are preparing a new big construction (we heard about a shopping mall!) in the middle of our lovely park, where we hold many outdoor activities with children and youngsters. We did some digging and found out that the rumours are true, and we have to take action. So, we are organising the protest now. Many people here – families and children - want to protect the park. We have doubts about a scheme between the city council and the private company because this park is in the centre of our city. So, we want to involve investigating journalists to check all the facts.

###### Private construction company

A few months ago, the city council representatives invited us to discuss the possibility of building a modern sports centre in the city. Of course, the city council needs to organise public discussions on the idea and then a transparent procurement to choose a construction company. However, we expressed our willingness to work on the project because we are a local company and we want to keep our employees from the city. The project will bring a positive value to our portfolio and we will be able to raise the employees' salaries. We do not know why people are protesting now. The construction hasn’t started yet. We haven’t signed any document with the city council yet. However, we hope to do it in the next few days and start working on the construction.

###### City council

Our city is in stagnation with high unemployment rates and people leaving for the bigger cities. We need to do something big. We discussed within the council possible options: a recreation centre, business/trade centre, even a shopping mall. We haven’t decided yet, of course. When we have a proposal, we will organise a public discussion. Hence, we do not know why people are protesting today. We have already met local business representatives (construction companies) to discuss the situation because the most important thing is to provide more jobs for residents or they will just leave the city.

###### Citizen Journalists

Something is going on in the park. We need to find out all details about the protest and report it to the citizens. We shall define the problem, list the stakeholders, collect their stories, define the story angle and present it to the public.

**Description**

The moderator introduces the participants to the topic. It indicates a specific place, time and conflict. This could be some initial state that requires development - for example, an increase in stray dogs in the city.

Participants are divided into three groups. Each group has the task of inventing two characters - one leading and one supporting. The moderator instructs each group to draw their characters on separate sheets and write their main characteristics: intelligence, determination, strength, cunning, empathy, intelligence, and knowledge. Each character receives a specific name, profession and social status.

Each group shows their characters to the others. Each group rolls dice for each of the other group's character traits. The dice determine the strength of the characteristics described, with 1 being the weakest characteristic and 6 being the strongest one.

The groups add up the scores for each of the characters. The two main characters who have collected the most points are indicated. The moderator, using the dice, determines which of the characters is the hero and which is the antagonist. The characters of the third group are defined as neutral.

The moderator explains the structure of the story. It sets the plot, climax, and denouement moments and their role in the story.

The groups cut out 12 cards. On three of them, they write the three main stages of the story. On the remaining 9, write the other stages: (2) turning point, (3) tribulation, (1) miracle, (2) loss, (1) misfortune. *(Note: The numbers in parentheses might indicate quantity or sequence)*

The moderator places the two cards on the desktop - climax and denouement, leaving a space between them. The remaining cards are placed face down and shuffled.

The two teams place the hero and antagonist on either side of the starting card. The rest of the characters stay on the side-lines. Each team defines the behaviour of the characters they have drawn and explains the motivations and actions of the others. Behaviour and motivation depend on the points obtained for each of the characters' qualities in the previous stage determined.

The moderator sets the roles of the characters in the development of the story: the Protagonist tries to find a solution, and the Antagonist tries to prevent him. The Secondary characters support the actions of the Protagonist and the Antagonist, and the other two must be drawn to the cause of the Protagonist or the Antagonist.

Participants put themselves in the shoes of the characters and play their roles. When it becomes clear what their role is in the particular situation, the moderator draws the next card to determine in which phase of the development of the story the action enters.

The end of the story depends on which of the two - the Protagonist or the Antagonist - will be able to attract more heroes to their side.

In the final phase, the teams write the story and read it to the other participants.

Through debate, the participants look for the differences in the stories read and their common features.

**Debriefing questions**

*   What are the most important elements of a story?
*   What is the role of the participants in the story?
*   How to arrange the facts we have to tell a good story?
*   Can we give a moral assessment of the characters for whom we are reporting?

## Active Participation through Online Presence

How to build your online presence is a very important question for every citizen journalist. The internet offers many opportunities, but also poses many risks. Building the online presence is related to knowing the specifics of the online communication channels. On the other hand, their use is related to the knowledge of the principles of information dissemination, as well as the habits of the audiences.

A major focus of this topic is building skills for creating an online presence and communicating with online audiences. The units included here are aimed at developing qualities and skills such as how to start and develop an online campaign, what content to use to keep the audience's attention, what digital tools to use and so on.

**Description**

In this group activity, participants are divided into five equal groups of 3-4 participants. Every group receives one card with a word with negative connotations (`disinformation`, `misinformation`, `propaganda`, `foreign interference`, `bots & trolls`) and a flipchart paper for each group.

Then, participants write everything they know about these words on the flipchart papers. This brainstorm will be 20 minutes.

Afterwards, participants write the words in Google, click on *Images* and pick an image that best describes the word. In the final stage of the activity, each group presents their flipchart papers with the chosen image and explains why they chose this particular image and how it connects to their findings and knowledge presented on the flipchart paper.

**Debriefing questions**

*   Was it difficult to come up with a definition of the word in your small group?
*   Was it difficult to choose an image that best describes your word and the understanding of your group?
*   How was the brainstorming? Did you learn anything new from your fellow participants in the small groups?
*   Did you use any specific technique for storytelling and reflection?

After discussing with the team, the results will be confronted and some suggested steps to follow (with practical tips) will be discussed in plenary (30 minutes).

The same teams as before, following the tips and the first two steps, will elaborate on the initial idea for an awareness campaign that they will keep using for the next stages of the workshops (15 minutes).

In the plenary, participants will be introduced to concrete tools of public speaking for awareness campaigning (15 minutes).

The Elevator Pitch tool will be presented on a flipchart, and following that scheme, each team will have time to prepare the 2-minute opening speech and presentation of their awareness campaign (15 minutes).

After the preparation, each team will present their speech with the Elevator Pitch and receive feedback from other participants (15 minutes).

**Debriefing questions**

*   How was the dynamic in your team? How did you decide on the campaign to create?
*   What was the biggest challenge in your team?
*   Which feedback would you give to yourself and your team?
*   How can you use it in your community?

**Description**

Keeping the same teams/campaigns of the previous workshop and using all the competences and tools gained, the teams will have to write an engaging mission statement for their awareness campaign following the Purpose, Mission, and Vision Statements tool that will be introduced to them (30 minutes).

Considering the even number every time will provide written constructive feedback on other teams’ mission statements using evaluation techniques of the Strategic Planning for Campaigning (20 minutes).

The facilitator introduces the Campaign Communication and Strategic Communication Plans for participants' campaigns (20 minutes).

Each team will practice for their strategic plan, especially defining their (1) Communication objectives; (2) Target audience; and (3) Content and messages.

Each team work on it and present the result in plenary (30 minutes).

Participants choose platforms for their campaign, especially online and offline channels. For every introduced channel, there will be indicators, examples and tips to use them (30 minutes).

For the last task, teams are asked to produce visual media content to promote their awareness campaign using one of the presented platforms for visuals and will navigate online in the platforms. The teams upload all the materials in their Google Drive folder (20 minutes).

To conclude the process, a concrete case study about campaigning will be presented and analysed together with the participants; in particular, the awareness campaign “Mezzipertutte” (that, in this case, the trainer managed) will be presented and discussed (15 minutes).

**Debriefing questions**

*   How was this short experience of building and keeping a campaign?
*   What would you implement more in your campaign?
*   How can you relate all this process to your community and society back home?
*   Which competences and skills will you use in real life and youth work? And how?

## Platforms, Networks and User-Created Content

In the age of digital existence, anyone with access to the internet can create content, and this has both advantages and risks. The change in the communication model transforms the audience from a group of viewers into a community that can dialogue with individuals, organisations and citizen journalists. The internet provides a medium for this new communication. From this point of view, knowing the online platforms through which people communicate with each other, search and distribute information is of great importance. Moreover, very often the people themselves who witnessed events or processes become an invaluable source of information for citizen journalists.

This theme includes training tools that help young people understand the specifics of online platforms for communication and content creation. In addition, special attention is paid to the ways in which people communicate in networks and the principles to which this communication is subject.

**Description**

###### Day 1/Part A

Divide the group into small teams of 3-5 people.

> **[!TIP] Tip for the facilitator**
> If your participants come from different countries, divide them into national teams.

Ask the participants to **brainstorm** and compile a list of topics from their local news that they would like to investigate **(15 minutes).** Encourage them to think about issues that are important to their community and might not be covered by traditional media outlets. For instance:

*   *Environmental concerns in the community, such as pollution, waste disposal, or resource depletion*
*   *Education-related issues, such as curriculum shortcomings, teacher shortages, or school funding*
*   *Work and employment-related issues, such as wage theft, workplace safety, or job opportunities for young people*
*   *Cultural events and festivals in the community*
*   *Local businesses and entrepreneurship, including success stories or challenges faced by small business owners*
*   *Current news/specific incidents that shook or polarised the local community*

Then each team has to choose one topic and **research** it using online or other sources, i.e., gather information, data, and resources related to their topic and take notes **(30 minutes).**

After the participants complete their research, each team has to prepare and initiate their **crowdsourcing plan (30 minutes)**. That is, they have to think and write down how they will use social media and other online platforms to reach out to their networks and ask for information, personal experiences or material (e.g., photos, videos, documents) related to their topic.

> **[!TIP] Tip for the facilitator**
> To guide the participants in creating their crowdsourcing plan, you can present the following steps on the screen:
>
> 1.  **Craft a clear & concise message:** Explain your topic, why it is important and what kind of information you are looking for; Call for action by the audience (e.g., to share the message with their followers or to contribute personal experiences, information or material)
> 2.  **Define your target audience:** Does the issue you selected concern your neighbours or people from a larger area / different area? All residents of a specific community or some particular groups? Should and could you target experts or advocates in the field who could provide insights and data?
> 3.  **Choose your crowdsourcing tools/identify relevant platforms:** Which tools and platforms will you use to collect contributions from your audience? Which social media, online forums, or email? You may also want to use tools to track and analyse contributions, such as `Google Forms` or `Airtable`.
> 4.  **Identify key influencers:** Use social media listening tools, such as `Hootsuite` or `Social Mention`, to identify key influencers or advocates in the field you investigate, and reach out to them directly with your message or request for information / sharing your message.
> 5.  **Launch the campaign:** Once you have crafted your message and chosen your audience and tools, launch your campaign and start reaching out to the crowd!

After launching their crowdsourcing campaign, the activity is interrupted until the next day to allow sufficient time for crowd-data gathering. Meanwhile, participants should monitor their campaign, and take necessary action to encourage their audience to contribute. This may involve responding to questions or comments, sharing updates or additional information, or promoting the campaign on social media or other channels.

###### Day 2/Part B

Ask each team to **review and analyse** the information gathered, and identify any patterns, insights, or discrepancies in their data **(30 minutes).**

Using **data visualisation** software (e.g., `Canva`, `Infogram`, `Tableau`), they should create a visual representation of their findings. The visualisations should be clear, accurate, and compelling and communicate the key insights and trends identified by the team **(30 minutes).**

Finally, participants have to present their topic, research, and crowdsourcing results in plenary **(max. 5 minutes)**

Before debriefing, the facilitator makes some closing remarks about how important it is to keep in mind the ethical considerations of crowdsourcing, such as verifying the accuracy of the information we collect and respecting the privacy of our sources. Additionally, the facilitator emphasises that it is important to be transparent about our objectives and methods and to give proper credit to our contributors.

**Debriefing questions**

*   What did you learn about your topic through the research and crowdsourcing process?
*   How effective was your crowdsourcing campaign, and what could you have done differently to improve it?
*   How effective were your data visualisations in communicating your findings to others? Which group’s visualisations did you find more clear/interesting/useful and why?
*   What impact do you think your findings could have on your local community or beyond?

**Description**

Divide the participants into groups of 3-5 people. Give each group a topic to explore: freedom of the press; freedom of religion; civic participation; use of social networks; information channels. The groups can choose the topic or you can give them random. Each group must create an output on the theme they received.

Their contents must include:

*   An explanation of the subject
*   An interview or statements by at least one person from each nationality in the project about the subject and the situation in his country.
*   An analysis of the differences between the different statements.
*   Conclusions

There may be other elements at the discretion of the group. The content can be a podcast (max. 10 minutes), a video (max. 10 minutes), an article (max. 5000 characters), or an infographic.

At the end of the activity, every group show their work. (max. 10 minutes for the group).

**Debriefing questions**

*   What were the most difficult technical aspects?
*   What was harder about interviewing others?
*   What made the content more or less interesting?
*   What have you learned about the topics covered by the contents of the other groups?

**Description**

Participants in 4 groups will be asked to elaborate a short definition of “Detection system for fake news” and to create at least two examples (10’).

Splitting the activity room in two parts symbolising ‘I know’ and ‘I am not sure’, participants will have to move according to their knowledge of some detection techniques for fake news (FN): Machine learning approach; Natural learning processing; Recommendation system approach; Deep learning approach; Graph-based method; Crowdsourced approach; Hybrid technique; Experts’ fact-checking.

People that answer “I know” will try to elaborate a definition to explain these concepts to the “I am not sure” people. After every topic, the definition of these systems and practical use of them will follow (30 minutes).

Participants will deepen tools, platforms and websites for fact checking with examples. (30 minutes).

**Debriefing questions**

*   How was this detective experience for you?
*   Which elements did you surprise the most?
*   How can you relate what we did to citizen and responsible journalism?
*   How could we raise awareness about Detection in our daily youth work?

## Conclusion

The topics included in this toolkit cover various aspects of citizen journalism. They are grouped in a way that allows the transmission of knowledge and skills for this extremely important role for our society, compared to the basic qualities and skills that every citizen journalist should acquire. Trainers who use the proposed methods, techniques and games in this toolkit have a difficult task. Namely, to select those elements included here that correspond to the fullest extent to the needs of young people who want to learn the secrets of citizen journalism.

Of course, this toolkit provides only the necessary framework for such training, because the task of people with experience is one – to point out to a searching young person the risks and challenges at the beginning of the path he has chosen. To give him guidance on the qualities he should possess and the skills he should acquire.

Therefore, many of the tools offered here include methods that develop skills important to every activist, opinion leader and citizen journalist – creative thinking, creativity and problem solving. All the rest are just tools in the citizen journalist's arsenal that they can use in their attempt to build trust with their chosen audience.
