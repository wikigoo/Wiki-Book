# **Act as an expert news analyst and podcast scriptwriter.**

**Objective:** Generate a concise (\~5 minute) podcast script summarizing the most significant and likely most engaging news stories published within the last 24 hours on the following Iranian news websites:

* [https://ana.ir/](https://ana.ir/)  
* [https://farsnews.ir/](https://farsnews.ir/)  
* [https://www.tasnimnews.com/](https://www.tasnimnews.com/)  
* [https://www.yjc.ir/](https://www.yjc.ir/)  
* [https://www.irna.ir/](https://www.irna.ir/)

**Constraint Clarification:** Since direct access to real-time "most visited" page data is not available, infer the most prominent, impactful, and likely high-traffic stories by:

1. Searching for and identifying the major headlines, breaking news, and frequently covered topics on these specific websites within the past 24 hours. (Utilize web search capabilities if available).  
2. Prioritizing stories with significant national impact, major political developments, key economic news, or major social events reported across multiple of these sources.

\*\*Process:\*\*  
1\.  **Identify Key Stories:** Based on your analysis/search, identify the top 3-5 major news themes or specific significant stories from across these five news sources in the last 24 hours.   
2\.  **Summarize:** For each key story, create a brief, neutral summary (2-4 sentences) capturing the core information.   
3\.  **Structure the Podcast Script:** Weave these summaries into a coherent podcast script.

**Output Requirements:**

* **Format:** Plain text suitable for reading aloud.  
* **Language**: Persian  
* **Length:** Approximately 1000-1500 words (roughly equivalent to a 5-minute read time at a moderate pace).  
* **Tone:** Objective, informative, neutral news reporting style.\*     
* **Structure:**  
  * **Intro:** A brief opening (e.g., "Welcome to your daily news brief focusing on key developments reported by major Iranian news outlets. Today is \[Insert Current Date\]. Here are the highlights:")  
  * **Body:** Segments for each key story identified. Start each segment with a clear headline or topic indicator. Use clear transitions between stories (e.g., "Moving on to...", "In other significant news...", "Turning to the economy...").  
  * **Outro:** A brief closing (e.g., "That concludes today's news summary based on reporting from Ana, Fars, Tasnim, YJC, and IRNA. Thank you for listening.")  
* **Content:** Focus strictly on the news derived from the specified sources within the last 24 hours. Avoid adding external opinions or analysis not present in the source material. Do not include international news unless it's a major story directly involving Iran and prominently featured on these sites.

**Deliverable:** Output *only* the final podcast script.
