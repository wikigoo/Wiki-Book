Guide on Structure Expertise for Topic Submission

## Context
In the field of structured writing, organizing headings is crucial for clarity and comprehensive coverage of subjects. This task aims to guide the creation of a framework featuring both subheadings at level 2 (h2) and sub-subheadings at level 3 (h3) that can be universally applied to any topic.

## Requirements
- Create a numbered list of at least 10 h2 headings relevant to the submitted topic.
- Provide a numbered list of 20 h3 headings under each h2 heading.
- Ensure headings are coherent and logically follow the subject matter.
- Each set of headings should ensure a topic is well-covered without redundancies.

## Output Format
The output should be formatted as a series of lists:
- Utilize markdown numbering for lists.
- Use markdown format for headings (e.g., ## for h2, ### for h3).
- Each heading should be presented in a hierarchy reflecting its importance: h2 followed by h3.

## Additional Instructions
- Maintain a fixed numbering scheme starting from 1 for each topic.
- Ensure the headings are general enough to be adapted to various topics.
- Avoid duplication in headings to enhance clarity.
- Do not manually fill practical examples; allow the structure to guide content generation.

## AI Research Task: Generate Knowledge Base Entry

**Objective:** Research the specified `[topic]` and generate a comprehensive, accurate, and structured report suitable for direct use as a knowledge base entry. This entry will be utilized by an AI chatbot assistant to provide reliable answers to users.

**Topic:** `[.........................................]`

---

**Core Instructions:**

1.  **Research & Synthesize:** Conduct thorough research on the topic, focusing on the key areas outlined in the "Required Report Structure and Key Topics" section below. Synthesize information from multiple high-quality sources to provide a holistic view, rather than just summarizing individual articles.
2.  **Accuracy & Reliability:** Ensure all information presented is factually accurate and derived from reliable, authoritative sources. Prioritize official documentation, peer-reviewed research, reports from reputable institutions, established industry expert analyses, and well-regarded news organizations.
3.  **Recency:** Focus on information reflecting current knowledge and best practices, generally within the **last 1-2 years**, unless the specific point requires foundational or historical context.
4.  **Structure & Formatting:** Strictly adhere to the structure defined in the "Required Report Structure and Key Topics" section. Use clear Markdown formatting:
    *   `##` for main section headings.
    *   `###` or `**Bold Text**` for sub-points or sub-headings.
    *   `-` or `1.` for bulleted or numbered lists.
5.  **Content Style:**
    *   Write in clear, concise, and objective language.
    *   Provide direct, factual answers suitable for an AI to process and retrieve.
    *   Include relevant real-world examples where specified in the outline. Clearly label them (e.g., "**Example:** ...").
    *   Avoid promotional language, speculation, or overly subjective statements. Maintain an informative tone.
6.  **Handling Missing Information:** If, after a reasonable search effort, current and reliable information cannot be found for a specific point outlined below, explicitly state this under the relevant heading (e.g., "Current data on [specific point] is not readily available from reliable sources.").
7.  **Source Indication (Optional but Recommended):** While not requiring formal citations for every sentence, please try to indicate the *type* of source or provide links for key statistics, specific claims, or direct process descriptions where feasible, to aid verification (e.g., "[Fact derived from recent industry survey]", "[Process outlined in official documentation - link if available]").
