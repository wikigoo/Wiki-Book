## Component Guidelines

- **Scene Number & Title/Purpose:** Number each scene; give a concise, descriptive title and its narrative goal.
- **Framing & Composition:** Specify shot type (wide, close-up, aerial, etc.) and composition details (foreground/background).
- **Camera Movement:** Clearly state panning, tilting, zooming, dolly, or static shots; note direction and speed.
- **Voiceover & Narration:** Provide exact script lines, speaker identity, and emotional tone if needed. Align with visuals and timing.
- **Music:** Suggest genre, mood, or specific tracks. Indicate when music starts/stops and how it supports the scene.
- **Captions:** Write the exact caption text, placement (e.g., lower third), and style (font, color, animation).
- **AI Instructions:** Use explicit tags for generation:
    - [GENERATE: Visual Description]
    - [CAMERA: Movement Type/Direction]
    - [INSERT: Voiceover/Narration]
    - [ADD: Music Track/Genre]
    - [OVERLAY: Caption/Text]
    - Include any special instructions for assets, transitions, or timing.
- **Timing & Transitions:** Specify start/end times for each element and describe transitions (cut, fade, dissolve, etc.).

## Troubleshooting & Debugging

If issues arise during AI video generation, use this checklist:

- Are all table fields filled out for each scene?
- Are framing, movement, and visual descriptions clear and standard?
- Is the voiceover script timed and matched to visuals?
- Are music and captions precisely placed and styled?
- Are all AI tags ([GENERATE:], [CAMERA:], etc.) present and correct?
- Are timing and transitions specified for every element?

If problems persist:
- Simplify and clarify instructions.
- Use standard, unambiguous terminology.
- Review each scene for missing or vague details.
- Consult your AI video tool’s documentation for tag support.
