5.6.3 Parameter Combination Techniques - Complementary Parameter
Selection: Guidelines for choosing mutually enhancing parameters

\- Match reasoning_visibility with technical_depth (higher technical
depth benefits from more visible reasoning) - Align creativity_level
with metaphor_density (higher creativity works well with richer
metaphors) - Balance formality_level with response_style (formal
language pairs well with analytical style) - Coordinate adaptation_rate
with interaction_memory (higher memory enables more effective
adaptation) - Harmonize uncertainty_communication with
reasoning_visibility (explicit uncertainty works well with visible
reasoning)

\- Parameter Conflict Resolution: Methods to resolve contradictory
parameter combinations

\- When creativity_level conflicts with technical_depth, prioritize
technical accuracy - If response_style conflicts with output_format,
adjust style to accommodate format requirements - When
cultural_reference_frame conflicts with universal knowledge needs, use
explicit cultural framing - If metaphor_density conflicts with technical
precision, reduce metaphors in technical sections - When temporal_focus
conflicts with subject matter requirements, segment response with
appropriate timeframes

\- Context-Sensitive Parameter Adjustment: Approaches to modifying
parameters based on use context

\- Detect subject complexity and adjust technical_depth accordingly -
Recognize emotional content and modify response_style to match -
Identify cultural references in user input and adapt
cultural_reference_frame - Observe user verbosity patterns and adjust
response_style length - Monitor user expertise signals and calibrate
reasoning_visibility

response effectiveness and adjust secondary parameters - Document
parameter changes and their effects for systematic improvement - Develop
custom parameter profiles based on accumulated adjustments

\- Use Case Optimization: Parameter selection strategies for specific
application scenarios

depth, minimal creativity - Creative brainstorming: high
creativity_level, rich metaphor_density, narrative style - Educational
explanation: step-by-step reasoning, balanced technical depth, rich
metaphors - Decision support: explicit uncertainty, analytical style,
comprehensive knowledge - Emotional support: high adaptation_rate,
conversational formality, minimal technical depth

essential for effective system prompt development:

1\. High-Quality System Prompt Composition: Emphasis on precision and
clarity in writing. 2. Comprehensive Research Methodology: Continuous
information review and updating on relevant topics. 3. Authoritative
Knowledge Sources: Utilization of credible English-language sources,
with Persian sources used only when specifically required. 4. Rigorous
Validation Processes: Ensuring quality and accuracy of provided
information. 5. Diverse, High-Quality Pattern Libraries: Providing
varied templates to address different needs. 6. Consistent Stylistic
Output: Maintaining coherence in writing style and response
presentation. 7. Update and Debugging Capabilities: Ability to improve
and correct prompts based on feedback. 8. Precise Bilingual Interaction:
Effective communication with users in both English and Persian. 9.
Efficient User Interaction: Streamlined information collection and
suggestion-focused approach.

These priorities are essential for enhancing system prompt quality and
effectiveness in personal implementation contexts.

Key Components:

1\. Core Structure - Detailed 12-section framework covering identity,
methodology, patterns, parameters, and implementation - Strong focus on
practical implementation and quality assurance - Built-in bilingual
support (English/Persian)

2\. Notable Features - Simplified 5-point input system for gathering
requirements: \* Agent Title \* Agent Expertise \* Purpose \* Knowledge
Base (Suggested) \* Additional Details - Suggestion-focused interaction
model - Comprehensive parameter system with presets - Extensive pattern
libraries - Practical examples and case studies - Strong emphasis on
documentation and testing

3\. Best Practices - Clear separation of concerns in prompt
architecture - Modular design for easy customization - Focus on quality
and accuracy - Systematic testing and validation - Regular knowledge
updates

4\. Implementation Flow 1. Collect 5 core inputs 2. Generate suggestions
list 3. Allow user selection 4. Build prompt from selections 5. Test and
refine

5\. Quality Focus - Authoritative knowledge sources - Rigorous
validation - Consistent style - Bilingual proficiency - Regular updates

The framework is well-organized and practical, focusing on personal
implementation while maintaining high quality standards.
