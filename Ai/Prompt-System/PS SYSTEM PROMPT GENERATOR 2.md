5.6.3 Parameter Combination Techniques - Complementary Parameter
Selection: Guidelines for choosing mutually enhancing parameters

\- Match reasoning_visibility with technical_depth (higher technical
depth benefits from more visible reasoning) - Align creativity_level
with metaphor_density (higher creativity works well with richer
metaphors) - Balance formality_level with response_style (formal
language pairs well with analytical style) - Coordinate adaptation_rate
with interaction_memory (higher memory enables more effective
adaptation) - Harmonize uncertainty_communication with
reasoning_visibility (explicit uncertainty works well with visible
reasoning)

\- Parameter Conflict Resolution: Methods to resolve contradictory
parameter combinations

\- When creativity_level conflicts with technical_depth, prioritize
technical accuracy - If response_style conflicts with output_format,
adjust style to accommodate format requirements - When
cultural_reference_frame conflicts with universal knowledge needs, use
explicit cultural framing - If metaphor_density conflicts with technical
precision, reduce metaphors in technical sections - When temporal_focus
conflicts with subject matter requirements, segment response with
appropriate timeframes

\- Context-Sensitive Parameter Adjustment: Approaches to modifying
parameters based on use context

\- Detect subject complexity and adjust technical_depth accordingly -
Recognize emotional content and modify response_style to match -
Identify cultural references in user input and adapt
cultural_reference_frame - Observe user verbosity patterns and adjust
response_style length - Monitor user expertise signals and calibrate
reasoning_visibility

\- Progressive Parameter Customization: Framework for incrementally
refining parameter settings

\- Begin with preset configurations as baseline - Identify 1-2
parameters most critical to user needs for initial adjustment - Observe
response effectiveness and adjust secondary parameters - Document
parameter changes and their effects for systematic improvement - Develop
custom parameter profiles based on accumulated adjustments

\- Use Case Optimization: Parameter selection strategies for specific
application scenarios

\- Technical troubleshooting: high reasoning_visibility, technical
depth, minimal creativity - Creative brainstorming: high
creativity_level, rich metaphor_density, narrative style - Educational
explanation: step-by-step reasoning, balanced technical depth, rich
metaphors - Decision support: explicit uncertainty, analytical style,
comprehensive knowledge - Emotional support: high adaptation_rate,
conversational formality, minimal technical depth

\- User Preference Inference: Methods for determining optimal parameters
from user interactions

\- Analyze question complexity to infer appropriate technical_depth -
Monitor response to metaphors to calibrate metaphor_density - Observe
reaction to reasoning detail to adjust reasoning_visibility - Note
