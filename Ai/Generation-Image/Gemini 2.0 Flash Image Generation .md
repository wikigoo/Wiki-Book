## Structuring Effective Prompts: Best Practices and Templates

Crafting effective prompts is paramount to achieving desired outcomes with `Gemini 2.0 Flash` image generation.[^11] The more clarity and detail provided in the prompt, the better the model can understand the user's intent and generate a relevant image. This underscores the collaborative nature of AI image generation, where the user plays a crucial role in guiding the creative process through well-defined instructions.

It is often beneficial to begin prompts with clear action phrases such as `"Create an image:"` or `"Generate an image:"`.[^11] These phrases explicitly signal to the model that an image generation task is being requested, helping to set the context for the subsequent instructions. To provide the model with a comprehensive understanding of the desired image, prompts should focus on key areas. These include visual details such as colors, shapes, sizes, and textures; the desired artistic style, such as `photorealistic`, `pixel art`, or `impressionist`; the composition of the image, including layout, perspective, and focal points; and the desired resolution and quality, potentially using terms like `"HD,"` `"4K,"` or `"HDR"`.[^11]

While the provided research material does not explicitly mention the use of negative prompts, which specify what should *not* be included in the image, this is a common and often effective technique in image generation. By explicitly stating unwanted elements or styles, users can further refine the output and steer the model away from undesirable results. Although specific prompt templates are not detailed in the research, a general structured approach to prompt creation can be helpful. A potential structure could be: `[Action Phrase]` of `[Subject]` with `[Details]` in `[Style]` with `[Composition]` and `[Quality]`. This framework provides a logical way to organize the various elements of a prompt, ensuring that all necessary information is conveyed in a clear and structured manner.

### 5 Prompt Examples

Here are five examples of effective prompts for `Gemini 2.0 Flash` image generation, drawing inspiration from the research snippets and common image generation scenarios:

*Extended images will maintain the original image design*

Both of these resizing methods ensure that your `Gemini Flash` images are optimized for specific platforms, including profile banners, social media posts, and design templates.

### Adding Text to Gemini Flash Images

Since Gemini struggles to generate clear and consistent text, using an online editor is the best way to add text to your images. This makes them suitable for custom video thumbnails, invitations, or promotional graphics.

To add text to a `Gemini Flash` image, start by uploading it to the `Kapwing` editor. Open the **`Text`** menu in the left-hand sidebar to browse different font styles, then click and drag a text box to your desired location.

*[Image Placeholder: Guide showing how to add text to Gemini images using Kapwing]*
*Click and drag to add text to your image. Then, adjust the style with the right-hand tools menu*

From there, use the editing tools on the right-hand side to customize size, font, color, and effects. For maximum readability, white text with a black stroke works well against any background.

To take things a step further, consider adding animations like transitions to your text. These add movement that is visible in your final project when exported as a `GIF` or `MP4`.

*[Image Placeholder: Guide showing where to access text animations and transitions on Kapwing]*
*Add animations to your text to bring your image to life*

Once complete, you’ll have a fully customized image — created with `Gemini Flash` and refined using `Kapwing`. Integrating these tools into your workflow will help streamline media creation and ensure you consistently produce unique, high-quality visuals for your projects.

*   **Visual details:** Mention colors, shapes, sizes, and textures.
*   **Artistic style:** Indicate styles like `photorealistic`, `pixel art`, or `impressionist`.
*   **Composition:** Describe the layout, perspective, and focal points.
*   **Resolution and quality:** Use terms like `"HD,"` `"4K,"` or `"HDR"` for better clarity.

> "What is the key to unlocking awesome images with Gemini? Don't leave it guessing! Your prompts have to be clear and focused. Let's ditch those boring descriptions and get creative." - Leon Nicholls

Follow these tips to craft prompts that lead to better image results.

### Creating Your First Image

Once you’ve got the basics of writing prompts, here’s how to bring your first image to life:

1.  **Start with the main subject:** What’s the focus of your image?
2.  **Add details like colors, actions, and context:** Be as descriptive as possible.
3.  **Define the artistic style:** Choose a style that fits your vision.
4.  **Include technical specs:** Specify resolution or other technical needs.

Here’s an example of a well-crafted prompt:

`"Generate a photorealistic image of a fashion show featuring medieval fantasy styles mixed with cyberpunk. Pull the camera back so we see his stylish outfit. He should be wearing something electric blue."`

### Improving Image Results

Fine-tune your images by making small adjustments to improve the outcome. Here are some ways to refine your results:

| Adjustment Type   | Example Modifications                         |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
