## Understanding Color in Video
### Background
Digital video captures color information using various color models and bit depths. Understanding these fundamentals is crucial for effective manipulation of color in post-production.

### Key Concepts
#### Color Models
RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is the primary color model used in digital video, with values typically ranging from 0-255 for each channel in 8-bit video. Professional workflows often use 10-bit or higher color depth for greater precision.

#### Scopes and Measurements
Video scopes provide objective measurements of video signals:
- Waveform: Shows brightness levels
- Vectorscope: Displays color information
- Histogram: Represents distribution of tonal values
- RGB Parade: Shows individual RGB channels
