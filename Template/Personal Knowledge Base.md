- [[Effects and Transitions]]
```

### Step 2: Create Connection Notes for Complex Relationships

For topics with many interconnections, create dedicated connection pages:

```markdown
# Connection: Video Production Workflow Integration

This page tracks how different video production workflows connect across tools and processes.

## Pre-Production Connections
- [[Script Structure]] → [[Storyboard]] → [[Project Setup and Organization]]

## Production Connections
- [[Framing]] and [[Exposure]] inform shooting techniques

## Post-Production Connections
- [[Adobe Premiere Pro Workflow]] incorporates:
  - [[Project Setup and Organization]]
  - [[Editing Workflow Guide]]
  - [[Effects and Transitions]]
  - [[Color Correction and Grading]]
  - [[Audio Editing in Premiere]]

## AI Integration Points
- [[AI Video Generation Overview]] connects with [[Editing Workflow Guide]]
- [[Voice Generation Tools]] enhances [[Audio Editing in Premiere]]
```

### Step 3: Implement a Visual Graph (Optional)

If you want to visualize connections between articles:

1. Use a tool like [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org/) to create a visual mind map
2. Export the visualization and upload it to your wiki
3. Create a "Knowledge Graph" page linking to the visualization

## 7. Optimizing Search Functionality

### Step 1: Implement Consistent Naming Conventions

Adopt a clear naming pattern for all wiki pages:

- Use category prefixes: `Video-Script-Ideas`, `Edit-Effects-Transitions`
- Use hyphens instead of spaces
- Include the content type in the name: `Guide-OBS-Installation`

### Step 2: Create a Search Guide Page

1. Create a new wiki page titled "Search-Guide"
2. Document search strategies and syntax

**Example Search Guide:**

```markdown
# Search Guide

## Basic Search
- Use the GitHub wiki search box in the upper right corner
- Enter keywords related to your topic
- Results are ranked by relevance

## Advanced Search Techniques
- Use domain prefixes: "Video-" to find all video-related pages
- Use content type prefixes: "Guide-" to find all guides
- Search by emoji: "📁" to find category pages, "📄" to find article pages
- Search by tag: include "#workflow" in your search

## Search Shortcuts
- To find all video production content: search for "Video-"
- To find all live streaming tools: search for "Live-Stream-"
- To find all AI resources: search for "AI-"
- To find all guides: search for "Guide-"
```

### Step 3: Implement a Table of Contents on Longer Pages

For lengthy articles, add a table of contents at the beginning:

```markdown
# Adobe Premiere Pro Workflow

## Table of Contents
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Project Setup](#project-setup)
- [Importing Media](#importing-media)
- [Basic Editing](#basic-editing)
- [Advanced Techniques](#advanced-techniques)
- [Export Process](#export-process)
- [Resources](#resources)

## Overview
...content follows...
```

## 8. Content Writing Best Practices

### Step 1: Structure Content in Digestible Sections

1. Break long content into clearly defined sections with headings
2. Use a consistent heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)
3. Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences maximum)

### Step 2: Implement Progressive Disclosure

Structure information from general to specific:

```markdown
# vMix Setup Guide

## Quick Setup (5 Minutes)
Essential steps to get vMix running quickly...

## Standard Configuration (30 Minutes)
Comprehensive setup for typical streaming scenarios...

## Advanced Configuration (1 Hour+)
In-depth customization for professional streaming setups...
```

### Step 3: Use Visual Elements to Enhance Understanding

Incorporate diagrams, images, and formatting to improve readability:

```markdown
# Framing Techniques for Video

## Rule of Thirds
![Rule of Thirds Grid](https://example.com/rule-of-thirds.jpg)

The rule of thirds divides your frame into a 3×3 grid. Placing key elements along these lines or at their intersections creates visual interest.

**Examples:**
- Place horizon on top or bottom third line
- Position subject at intersection points
- Align leading lines with vertical thirds

## Shot Types
| Shot Type | Description | Best Used For |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Wide Shot | Shows entire scene | Establishing location |
| Medium Shot | Shows subject from waist up | Dialogue scenes |
| Close-Up | Shows face or detail | Emotional moments |
| Extreme Close-Up | Shows specific detail | Emphasizing importance |
```

## 9. Leveraging AI Tools for Content Enhancement

### Step 1: Set Up an AI Assistant Integration Workflow

1. Create a new wiki page titled "AI-Enhancement-Workflow"
2. Document your process for using AI to improve content

**Example Workflow:**

```markdown
# AI Enhancement Workflow

## Preparation
1. Draft initial content in the wiki using appropriate template
2. Identify areas that need enhancement (clarity, detail, organization)
3. Extract text that needs improvement

## Using Claude for Enhancement
1. Copy the section needing improvement
2. Prompt Claude with specific instructions:
   - "Improve the clarity of this explanation while maintaining accuracy"
   - "Expand on these points with practical examples"
   - "Reorganize this information for better logical flow"
3. Review AI suggestions and edit as needed
4. Incorporate improved content back into wiki

## Using Claude for Content Generation
1. Create a clear prompt describing the content needed
2. Include specifications like tone, length, and technical level
3. Request content in Markdown format compatible with GitHub wiki
4. Review and edit the generated content
5. Add to wiki with appropriate metadata and links
```

### Step 2: Create AI Prompt Templates

Develop standardized prompts for common enhancement needs:

```markdown
# AI Prompt Templates

## Content Expansion Prompt
```
Please expand on the following concept, adding more detail, examples, and practical applications while maintaining the original meaning:

[Insert text here]

Please format your response in GitHub-compatible Markdown.
```

## Clarity Improvement Prompt
```
Please improve the clarity and readability of the following text while preserving all key information. Break into shorter paragraphs where appropriate and use bullet points for lists:

[Insert text here]

Please format your response in GitHub-compatible Markdown.
```

## Summarization Prompt
```
Please create a concise summary (3-5 bullet points) of the main ideas in this text:

[Insert text here]

Please format your response in GitHub-compatible Markdown.
```
```

### Step 3: Document AI Usage Guidelines

Create guidelines for when and how to use AI assistance:

```markdown
# AI Usage Guidelines

## Appropriate Uses
- Improving clarity of technical explanations
- Generating initial drafts of structured content

   - Use Markdown linters to ensure consistent formatting
   - Set up automated backups of your local repository
   ```

### Step 2: Implement Custom CSS (If Supported)

If your GitHub wiki setup supports custom styling:

1. Create a file named `_Sidebar.css` or `custom.css`
2. Add custom styles to enhance readability and organization

**Example Custom CSS:**

```css
/* Improve readability */
.markdown-body {
  max-width: 900px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.6;
}

/* Style category tags */
.category-tag {
  background-color: #e1f5fe;
  padding: 3px 8px;
  border-radius: 3px;
  font-size: 14px;
  margin-right: 5px;
}

/* Style metadata section */
.metadata {
  background-color: #f8f9fa;
  padding: 15px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  font-size: 14px;
}

/* Style section headings */
h2 {
  border-bottom: 2px solid #0366d6;
  padding-bottom: 5px;
}
```

### Step 3: Set Up Automated Workflows (Advanced)

For technical users, create GitHub Actions workflows:

1. Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your main repository
2. Add workflow files for automated tasks

**Example: Link Checker Workflow**

```yaml
name: Check Wiki Links

on:
  gollum:  # Triggered when wiki is edited
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Run weekly

jobs:
  check-links:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          repository: ${{ github.repository }}.wiki
          
      - name: Link Checker
        uses: lycheeverse/lychee-action@v1
        with:
          args: --verbose --no-progress './**/*.md'
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          
      - name: Create Issue on Failure
        if: ${{ failure() }}
        uses: peter-evans/create-issue-from-file@v4
        with:
          title: Broken links detected in wiki
          content-filepath: ./lychee/out.md
          labels: documentation, maintenance
```
