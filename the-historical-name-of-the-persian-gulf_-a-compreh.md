# The Historical Name of the Persian Gulf\_ A Compreh

**The Historical Name of the Persian Gulf: A Comprehensive Analysis**

This report presents a detailed examination of the historical naming of the Persian Gulf, tracing its designation throughout various historical periods, geographical representations, and scholarly works. Evidence consistently demonstrates that "Persian Gulf" has been the predominant and historically accurate name for this body of water since ancient times. While naming disputes emerged in the mid-20th century with the rise of Arab nationalism, historical documentation overwhelmingly supports the Persian Gulf designation across cultures, languages, and time periods.

**Ancient Historical Documentation**

The term "Persian Gulf" has been consistently used in various ancient documents across different civilizations and languages. Roman and Latin historical sources provide some of the earliest formal documentation of the name, referring to this body of water as "Sinus Persicus" or "Persian Bay" dating back to the time of Alexander the Great's conquests in the 4th century BC<sup>\[1]</sup>. This consistent nomenclature served as the foundation for subsequent references throughout history.

Archaeological evidence further supports the historical naming convention. For instance, in Kuwait, archaeologists discovered one of the rare Syriac inscriptions in the Arab-Persian Gulf region, dating between the late 7th and early 9th centuries<sup>\[2]</sup>. This find, while not directly naming the Gulf, represents one of the rare written testimonies discovered in the region and contextualizes the cultural landscape surrounding the Persian Gulf during this period.

The naming convention continued throughout the medieval period as well. Arab historians and geographers consistently used the term "Persian Gulf" in their documentation. Notable among them was Agapius, a Melkite Arabic-speaking historian writing in the 10th century, who referred to this body of water as the Persian Gulf in his works<sup>\[3]</sup>. This demonstrates that even Arab scholars and historians traditionally recognized and used the name "Persian Gulf" in their writings.

**Ptolemaic and Roman References**

The Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy provided some of the most influential early geographical descriptions of the region. In his comprehensive work "Geographia," Ptolemy identified and clearly labeled the water body as "Sinus Persicus"<sup>\[1]</sup>. The persistence of this name through translations and reproductions of Ptolemy's work helped cement the designation across European scholarly traditions.

Roman military and trade expeditions also documented their interactions with the region using this nomenclature. During the Roman-Persian Wars, strategic documents and military reports consistently referred to the "Sinus Persicus" when discussing naval maneuvers and coastal territories<sup>\[1]</sup>. This military documentation provides additional evidence for the official recognition of the name at governmental and institutional levels.

**Historical Cartographic Representations**

Maps serve as crucial historical documents that reflect both geographical knowledge and naming conventions of their eras. Throughout cartographic history, the Persian Gulf has been consistently labeled as such across diverse mapping traditions.

**Ptolemaic Cartography**

Ptolemy's influential maps, though the originals have not survived, were reconstructed from his texts during the medieval period. All world maps derived from Ptolemy's work show the Persian Gulf (Sinus Persicus) in a nearly rectangular shape, placed at almost the correct latitude<sup>\[4]</sup>. The first printed edition of Ptolemy's "Geographia" with maps appeared in Bologna in 1477, followed by more than fifty editions in Latin and other European languages until 1730 or later, all maintaining the "Sinus Persicus" designation<sup>\[4]</sup>.

**Medieval and Renaissance Cartography**

The tradition of naming the gulf as "Persian" continued through medieval Islamic and European cartography. Gerard Mercator, one of history's most influential cartographers, labeled the gulf as "Sinus Persicus, nunc Mare de Balsera" ("Persian Gulf, now Sea of Basra") on his 1541 terrestrial globe<sup>\[3]</sup>. This naming reflects both the traditional designation and contemporary Ottoman influence following their capture of Baghdad in 1534, which gave Turkey access to the Indian Ocean via the port of Basra at the head of the Persian Gulf<sup>\[3]</sup>.

Interestingly, on Mercator's world map of 1569, he changed the name to "Mare di Mesendin" (after the peninsula Ra's Musandam), but this alternative naming did not persist in subsequent cartographic traditions<sup>\[3]</sup>. The temporary deviation actually underscores how firmly established the "Persian Gulf" designation was, as it quickly returned to common usage despite brief variations.

**Modern Mapping Traditions**

The 1930 Survey of India map offers a more recent historical example of the continued use of the Persian Gulf designation. This map details the coastline of the Persian Gulf, encompassing areas from Saudi Arabia and Iraq to eastern Iran and from Yazid in Iran to the present-day United Arab Emirates (then "Trucial Oman") and the Gulf of Oman<sup>\[5]</sup>. The persistence of this naming convention into the 20th century demonstrates its entrenched status in official cartography.

**Scholarly Consensus Throughout History**

Academic and scholarly works have consistently reinforced the Persian Gulf designation through rigorous research and documentation. Experts from diverse fields including archaeology, geography, history, and linguistics have affirmed the historical accuracy of this naming.

**Roman and Classical Scholarship**

Pliny the Elder, in his exhaustive work "Natural History," references the "Sinus Persicus" while describing the world's known geography during his time<sup>\[1]</sup>. His contemporary Ptolemy similarly identified the gulf in his comprehensive geographical studies. These works became foundational texts for subsequent generations of scholars and remained authoritative for centuries.

During the Byzantine era, as continuators of the Roman legacy, scholars maintained the name "Sinus Persicus" in their literature, especially in contexts related to their interactions with the Sassanid Persians<sup>\[1]</sup>. This continuity demonstrates how deeply established the name was across changing political landscapes.

**Modern Academic Approaches**

Contemporary scholars have documented the historical naming conventions through rigorous academic research. In "Selective Remembrances," authors Philip L. Kohl, Mara Kozelsky, and Nachman Ben-Yehuda provide historical context for the naming dispute, noting that the term "Arabian Gulf" was first advocated by a Westerner, Sir Charles Belgrave, the British adviser to the ruler of Bahrain, in 1955<sup>\[3]</sup>. This research highlights that the alternative naming is relatively recent and politically motivated rather than historically based.

The Encyclopedia Iranica, a comprehensive scholarly reference work on Iranian history and culture, documents how Persian Gulf cartography evolved through different historical periods while maintaining the consistent nomenclature<sup>\[4]</sup>. This scholarly continuity reinforces the historical legitimacy of the Persian Gulf designation.

**Historical Documentation Across Cultures**

The name "Persian Gulf" appears consistently across diverse historical texts, chronicles, and official documents from multiple civilizations and in various languages, demonstrating its cross-cultural acceptance.

**Trade and Commercial Records**

Roman trade documents and contracts mention the Persian Gulf as a critical nexus in the maritime segment of the Silk Road<sup>\[1]</sup>. These commercial records provide evidence of the practical, everyday usage of the name in economic contexts beyond purely academic or political spheres.

The Gulf's strategic importance for trade, particularly its pearl banks and fisheries that were esteemed in Roman markets, further embedded the name "Sinus Persicus" in commerce-related documentation<sup>\[1]</sup>. Merchants, traders, and commercial agents across diverse cultural backgrounds recognized and used this designation in their correspondence and ledgers.

**Religious and Cultural Texts**

With the spread of Christianity throughout the region, Christian chronicles and religious texts maintained the Persian Gulf designation in their narratives and geographical descriptions<sup>\[1]</sup>. These religious documents, often created for purposes entirely separate from political concerns, provide additional evidence for the widespread acceptance of the name.

Similarly, Islamic geographical works consistently referred to the body of water as the Persian Gulf throughout the medieval and early modern periods. This consensus across religious traditions demonstrates the name's status as a neutral geographical designation rather than a politically charged term.

**The First Persian Gulf War**

The Persian Gulf has been the site of significant military conflicts in modern history, with the most prominent being the Gulf War of 1990-1991. This conflict was a pivotal moment in the region's history and occurred within the geographical context of the Persian Gulf.

The Gulf War involved an armed conflict between Iraq and a 42-country coalition led by the United States, conducted in two key phases: Operation Desert Shield, the military buildup from August 1990 to January 1991, and Operation Desert Storm, which began with the aerial bombing campaign against Iraq on January 17, 1991, and concluded with the American-led liberation of Kuwait on February 28, 1991<sup>\[6]</sup>.

The conflict began when Iraq, under Saddam Hussein's leadership, invaded neighboring Kuwait on August 2, 1990, and fully occupied the country within two days<sup>\[6]</sup>. This invasion prompted international response and military intervention within the Persian Gulf region. The name "Gulf War" itself, while abbreviated, derives from the Persian Gulf designation and further reinforces the traditional naming of the region even in contemporary military contexts.

**The Origins of the "Arabian Gulf" Terminology**

The alternative designation "Arabian Gulf" emerged relatively recently and can be traced to specific political developments in the mid-20th century. This naming divergence represents a departure from historical precedent rather than a competing historical tradition.

**Sir Charles Belgrave's Influence**

According to scholarly research, Sir Charles Belgrave, the British adviser to the ruler of Bahrain, was "the first westerner to use and advocate the name 'Arabian gulf', first in the journal Soat al-Bahrain (Voice of Bahrain) in 1955"<sup>\[3]</sup>. This represents a significant departure point from centuries of consistent naming practice and occurred within a specific political context of British influence in the region.

**Connection to Arab Nationalism**

Mahan Abedin of The Jamestown Foundation confirms that Arab countries used the term "Persian Gulf" until the 1960s<sup>\[3]</sup>. However, with the rise of Arab nationalism during that decade, some Arab countries, including those bordering the Gulf, adopted widespread use of the term "al-Khalīj al-ʻArabī" (Arab Gulf or Arabian Gulf) to refer to this waterway<sup>\[3]</sup>.

The political motivation behind this naming shift is further illuminated by Teymoor Nabili, a senior presenter for Al Jazeera English, who noted that "ironically, among the major drivers of the movement for change were Arab perceptions that Iran, driven by Washington, had supported Israel during the Arab-Israeli war of 1973"<sup>\[3]</sup>. This connection to regional geopolitics and the Arab-Israeli conflict underscores the political rather than historical basis for the alternative naming.

**Official Egyptian Documentation**

Despite later Arab nationalist movements advocating for the "Arabian Gulf" terminology, historical evidence shows that official Arab documentation continued to use "Persian Gulf" well into the 20th century. An official letter from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser to a Bahraini government official used the name "Persian Gulf" (الخليج الفارسي) in Arabic, demonstrating that even key Arab nationalist figures initially recognized the historical naming convention<sup>\[3]</sup>.

**Regional Conflicts and the Persian Gulf**

The Persian Gulf has been the setting for several significant military conflicts that have shaped regional and global politics in the modern era. These conflicts are collectively known as the Persian Gulf Wars, reflecting the geographical designation of the region where they occurred.

The most prominent of these conflicts was the Gulf War of 1990-1991, when Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, prompting an international military response<sup>\[6]</sup>. This conflict resulted in approximately 13,488 coalition casualties, while Iraqi forces suffered between 20,000-50,000 killed, 75,000+ wounded, and 80,000-175,000 captured<sup>\[6]</sup>. The human toll extended to civilians as well, with over 1,000 Kuwaiti civilians killed, 600 missing, and 3,664 Iraqi civilians directly killed in the conflict<sup>\[6]</sup>.

These conflicts, while devastating in their human and economic costs, have consistently been documented in historical and military records as occurring in the Persian Gulf region, further cementing the traditional naming convention in contemporary global discourse and military history.

**Ecological Significance of the Persian Gulf**

Beyond historical naming conventions and geopolitical conflicts, the Persian Gulf represents a unique and valuable ecosystem with significant biodiversity that warrants protection and conservation efforts.

**Environmental Characteristics**

The Persian Gulf covers an area of approximately 241,000 square kilometers, with a length of about 990 km and width varying from a maximum of about 340 km to a minimum of 55 km in the Strait of Hormuz<sup>\[7]</sup>. It possesses distinct environmental characteristics as a semi-closed sea, estimated to be 15,000 years old, with an average depth of 35 meters. The Gulf is characterized by high salinity, severe heat fluctuations, and an annual evaporation rate of 140 cm<sup>\[7]</sup>.

**Biodiversity and Conservation Challenges**

The Persian Gulf hosts an impressive array of marine life, including 2 species of dolphin and whale, 1,100 species of fish, and 5 species of turtle<sup>\[7]</sup>. Additionally, it contains the second largest population of manatees globally, 232 seaweed species, and serves as a habitat for 4 million migratory birds annually<sup>\[7]</sup>. However, this rich biodiversity faces significant threats, with 240 important species and many habitats currently endangered.

The ecosystem faces multiple environmental challenges, including acidification, reduction of oxygen, rising temperatures, and perhaps most critically, pollution of the aquatic environment<sup>\[7]</sup>. These factors have caused significant damage to the watershed and its inhabitants, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts and environmental protection initiatives.

**Conclusion**

The historical evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the name "Persian Gulf" has been the consistent and predominant designation for this body of water across diverse civilizations, languages, and time periods. From ancient Roman and Greek sources referring to "Sinus Persicus" to medieval Arab historians and cartographers maintaining the same terminology, the historical record shows remarkable consistency in naming this important geographical feature.

The alternative designation "Arabian Gulf" emerged relatively recently in the mid-20th century, primarily driven by political motivations connected to Arab nationalism rather than historical precedent. This naming dispute represents a departure from centuries of consistent historical documentation across cultures and disciplines.

Beyond the naming controversy, the Persian Gulf remains a region of tremendous ecological, historical, and geopolitical significance. Its rich biodiversity faces substantial environmental challenges that require conservation efforts, while its strategic position has made it the setting for significant military conflicts in recent history. Understanding the full historical context of the Persian Gulf, including its consistent naming throughout history, provides valuable perspective on current issues affecting this vital region.
